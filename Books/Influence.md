## A book examines the "click and run" patterns - how to "unintentionally" manipulate people's autopilot decisions 

***
### Social Proof - we tend to more easily commit any action following the example of other people 
1. The more people are repeating an action the stronger the effect/more appropriate it seems 
	1. If we want to make people kill themselves - publish news about suicide - people will think that it is more "appropriate" or "acceptable" to commit it
	2. It works even with pictures 

2. We tend to get along with people **who are similar/related** to us 
	1. If we want to influence mid aged mortgage buyers - look/act like one 

3. With higher confusion we trust the herd **more**

4. We can "normalize" the situation
	1. Showing that "many" people do something bad, in attempt to discourage, can have a counter-productive effect 

5. **Trend** - if current minority is increasing, ppl make a decision based on **future composition**
	1. Young startup currently has nothing to show, however it displays increasing trend to use the product - user things that everyone **will use it**, therefore selects current minority side

### Authority - we tend to automatically trust someone who is "professional" or our superior. It occurs when we realize that obedience is rewarding, after that we turn on an autopilot 
- Will work even for egoist, if authority is outside of his field of interest... khe-khm 
- Titles and visuals(clothing, cars or any other authority symbol) can convey or falsify the authority 
- With more "authority" features **halo effect** can be triggered

- Trustworthiness can be accumulated - trick to display negative facts upfront and then move to 
	- Imitate sacrifice of own interest, can be imitated or exaggerated, and then move back "from the kindness of your heart" to normal with created trustworthiness

#### Key is to create an expert image of proved sincerity 

***
### Scarcity - loss aversion and supply & demand games. Creating illusion of possible scarcity makes item/deal more attractive & desirable 

- If no scarcity exist, focus on unique product features that **aren't** available in other 

- **Scarcity provoked by competition is more powerful** 

- **Contrast & differentiation** - we can use a) contrast of "something" and then take it away(replace old taste of Coke for new); b) take away a differentiation factor(reward symbol or give it to everybody)

- We can sell distinctiveness and manipulate the contrast/restrictions of freedom & scarcity 

- #### To sum up Scarcity - Competitiveness, contrast, differentiation, (time) limitation +freshness(became undersupplied)  are needed to create pressure

*Note example at p 288* 

***

### Commitment & Consistency - people tend to proceed with promise/commitment after explicitly stating it. *People are stubborn* - rarely open minded
- People, firmly, resort the labor of thinking, making decisions and don't want to be disappointed, therefore lose hope in something they had make a commitment 
	- Putting money into charlatan program/course which makes them **believe** into it's benefits 
	- Put money into loosing company/venture and boil slowly with it

- #### Foot in the door - start with small commitments and then gradually increase the deal
	- Let people start small - syndrome of non-forfeiture loss + commitment to finish what was started;
	- Provide easy first step - in insurance help to file application 

- Commitment can start as simple as writing it 

- #### People think that statement describes true belief who did it 
	- If i am asked to write a pro-russian essay - i truly support russia 
	- Defending Nietzsche's one argument - i like Nietzsche
	- **Comes from halo effect when we complete the picture based on available information. Although coercion does not imply causation**

- Public commitment is more potent 
- Domino effect - committing in one area can expand into related  

- #### Low-Ball - lure client into below market deal, develop his commitment & attachment -> reverse deal price back to market by "mistake"

- Lure victim into consistency, make them disclose their commitment and then make an offer you had in mind initially

### Unity - autopilot to emphasize members of *our* group/class/team
- Related to "like-alike" but reveals points of pressure related to family/community members
- You can convince or state that someone is your kin by mentioning **anything** personally related to 'em
-
