### Concepts:

#### *Turbofan* Engine Structure - newest variation of basic gas turbine 
- Fan - large, takes huge amount of air inside. Air split into **cooler which bypasses the second fan**; one which goes into **compressor**
- Compressor - squeezes the entering into smaller area - increases its pressure; hence increasing its energy, before being forced into **combutsor** **chamber** 
- Combustor - **air mixes with fuel and ignites**. Produced hot/high energy airflow; uses ceramic materials for better temperature resistance  
- Turbine - hot airflow, goes into turbine with many thousands blades, which makes them rotate
- Nozzle - **exhaust (вихлоп) duct**(витяжной канал) of an engine;  produces most of engines **thrust**, buy exhaust the hot air produced in the turbine and **cold which was bypassing engines core**.

#### Turbojet Engine Structure - *big gas engines with FIRE*
- Compresses the air in 3 to 12 times its original pressure 
- **Thrust** occurs when highly pressured and velocity gas; maybe do even better with **afterburner**

- **Afterburner** - used in high performance - supersonic jets; simply add section where additional fuels is mixed with hellish gas
