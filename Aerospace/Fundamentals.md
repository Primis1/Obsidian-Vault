### Special values:
1. Aerodynamics - lift, force, thrust, drug **which result in movement**  

### Concepts:

#### Forces of Flight:
- **Thrust** - moves airplane forward. It comes from an engine, which turns propeller, what create jet propulsion

- **Drug** - *frictional* (friction - тертя) force which creates a *drug resisting*. It appears when object it going again air particles

- **Lift** - minimum lift force which makes an object fly must be greater than its weight
	- *Newton's Third Law*: "**When one body exerts the force of a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body**"

- **Weight** - is the second body's force of an object in Newton's Law. Weight should be **balanced** across all flying object

#### Airfoil - special shape of a wing (blade) which make an air from upside move slower than downside. Which makes pressure and lifts *the wing* *up*

#### Mach - number equal to the speed of sound 340.29 m/s)
