### Special values:
1. #aerodynamics - science which learns how gas like objects are flowing

### Concepts:

#### #pressure - force of resistance per unit  of area; Pressure is vary from point to point$$P=\frac{F}{A}$$
- Maybe measured in: 
	- Pa - pascals$$1Pa=\frac{1N}{m^2}$$
	- atm -  atmospheres; **1 atm ≈ 101,325 Pa**
#### #density (плотность) - mass divided by the volume of its container (gas measurements) 
- In #aerodynamics, density is defined by $$D=\frac{Mass}{\text{Unit of Volume}}$$
- As with #pressure, #density is vary from point to point

#### #tempreratur - hotness/coldness
- For gasses temperature is a proportional to its #kinetic energy of particles of gas
- Gas particles which does not move, therefore have *0* #kinetic energy is obtained with absolute *0* temperature

#### #velocity - speed combined with direction;
