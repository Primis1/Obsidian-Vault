### Special values:

### TLTR:

##### ==Overdriving your== headlights - you go so fast that your stopping distance is larger than area where you can see 

##### Fog - if too strong, move to closest parking area
- Use lower beams 

##### Rain - makes breaking less effective 

##### ==Skids== - take off the accelerator and brake, change transition into neutral. Continue to steer in wanted direction
- When control regained, brake as needed

##### Threshold braking - not pumping the brake, but pushing it in full force times to time when wheel locks

#### Dealing with emergencies

##### If your brakes fail - **pump it**

##### If your gas pedal sticks - take it up by slipping your feet under 

##### If you have trouble on a freeway - pull over, and call for help, do not take up a hood 

##### If your wheels go off the pavement - take foot off the gas, avoid heavy braking. Steer towards the pavement 

##### If a tire blows out - take off the gas and steer toward where you want. Bring the vehicle to stop off the road:
- 

##### In a collision where someone ==is injured==: 
- Every driver involved in a collision must stay at the scene or return to it immediately and give all possible assistance

##### In a collision where someone ==is **not** injured==: 
- If derivable - move from the road 

### Always put a hazard light on
