#### Special values:
1. #graph - mathematic structure, used for modeling pairwise relations between objects
	- In scientific form, #graph is the ordered pair *G={N,E}*
		- Where *N* is a ==Node==, *E `⊆ {{x, y} | x, y $⊆$ V and x != y}` is a set of edges, which are unordered pairs of ==Nodes==* 
1. #graph parts:
	1. vertices/nodes - place where an element contains 
	2. edges - path to another node, that connects those two
#### To know: 

##### Facts:
1. Kinds of graphs:
	1. undirected #graph - edges link two nodes ==symmetrically==   
	2. directed #graph - edges link two nodes ==asymmetrically== 

##### Formula:
$$(n/2)$$that is equal to: $$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$
