[[Sets]]
### Special values:
1. Sigma sign/sum - function notation which describes the operations over the sets in shorter way 

### To know:

#### Syntax:
1. We sum whatever is after Î£: $$\sum_{n=4}^i n$$
	1. We sum `a`\
	2. Below and Above, show numbers from what, to what we should `sum` 
$$\sum_{n=4}^4 n = 1 + 2+ 3+ 4 = 10; n = 10$$


#### Implementation:
$$\sum_{n=4}^4 (2n+1) = 3 + 5 + 7 +9=24$$

$$\sum_{i=3}^5 \frac{i}{i+1} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{5}{6} =24$$
