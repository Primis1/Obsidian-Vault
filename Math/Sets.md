### Special values:
1. #set - in math it is basically the collection of values 
	1. $∈$ - identifies the element in the #set. $x ∈ A$
	2. subsets:
		1. $⊂$ - set A has some elements of set B, therefore is not equal    
		2. $⊆$ - proper set, sets are equal to each other $A ⊆ B$ the same as $A = B$  
		3. $⊊$ - set A has NOT a single element of set B
### To know

#### Syntax:
1. A = {1,2,3,4} ; F={0<= n <= 19}, $$1 ∈ A,  20 ∉ F$$
2. Subsets: 
$$A={1,2,3,4}$$
$$B={1,2,3,4}$$
$$A⊆B$$


$$A={1,2,3}$$
$$B={1,2,3,4}$$
$$A⫋B$$
