### Special values:

1. **TEU** - Twenty-foot equivalent unit/6 meters 
	1. 1 foot = 0.3m
2. **Charter rates** - fees paid for lease a vessel for a specific voyage, under specific price/day 

##### Market size has CAGR is 3.6%, expected to grow to from 81 to 116 b by 2035 

Market is driven by rapid growth of e-commerce and arbitrage among countries. Business like commodity, relies on global macro economics 

##### Containers, by itself, rely on steel price. Due to high quality steel requirements and its volatility, makes container business similar to oil/gas

##### Charterers - third party who rent a vessel
1. May or may not provide a crew
2. Rent is going a day, therefore the longer the route the bigger the price for rent
3. Charterers responsible for fuel fees and leasers for maintenance 

##### Trends
1. Smart container technology - monitoring systems(`loT devices and RFID tags`), which track temperature, humidity and location 
	1. Driven by e-commerce and used for sensitive products such as `foods and pharma`
2. E-commerce & Economic cycles - the more trade is required by businesses the bigger revenue of those who provide ships
#### Break-Bulk vs Containers:
1. Break-Bulk is a transportation by unit, rather than standardizes blocks(containers)
	1. Large or irregularly shaped goods (`machinery, steel coils, lumber, vehicles, and oversized equipment`)
	2. Ships used: 
		1. Break-bulk carriers
		2. Multipurpose ships
		3. General cargo vessels

2. Containerized Shipping is transported in standardized containers(**20-foot or 40-foot containers**)
	1. Efficient in transportation, loading/uploading and costs
	2. Faster and more technological alternative for for bulks 
	* *No one fucken knows the share between bulk and non-bulk containers, however from rough calculation we assume that proportion is 60-70% of bulks and around 25-30% containers*
	* However these 25-30 shipment unit carry over 40% of moving volumes  
* Assumption:![[Pasted image 20250201020901.png]]

#### Types:
- Bulks - mostly carry dry cargo
	- **Break Bulk**: drums, bags, pallets, or boxes. Such ships are typically geared.
	- **Neo Bulk**: each pre-packaged unit is accountable such as lumber (bundles), paper (rolls), steel, and vehicles

- Container Ships - transport standardized containers. Size of transportable containers may vary, therefore ship varies too
	- Feeder - **1,000–3,000 TEU**(`38.5 k - 115 k m^3`) - transports to smaller ports on shorter distance often within a region 
	- Intermediate - **3,000–10,000 TEU**(`115 k - 385 k m^3`) - access more ports and may ship on a long-haul routes (Asia-Europe)

- Tankers - carry liquid cargo(oil, gas, chemicals)

- Roll-on/Roll-off - transport wheeled cargo like cars and trucks

- Specialized Vessels - heavy lift ships 
#### Risks of Industry:
3. **Drugs**, if drugs were found in one of cargoes, despite companies didn't mind any illegal activities *penalties will charged*

4. Routes and container price - vessels are moving through exact routes and market has its own standard for pricing each transferred container. Like OPEC with oil. Therefore operating income and margins are subjects of volatility 
	1. **The linger the route, the higher the price for transportation, the better operating income is**

#### Averages for the industry:
5. ROIC - **7.83%** current 
6. Revenue Growth - 11.3%
7. Market size - **?
	1. However market increase after boom of e-commerce, +its cyclical nature and reliance on economics cycles(the better economical well-being, hence trade, the better in most case scenarios) benefits the industry at the moment(i guess we were in expansion stage)
