## Blue Bird Corporation (BLBD) - Porter's Five Forces: Bargaining power of suppliers

### Limited Number of Specialized Manufacturers

As of 2024, Blue Bird Corporation faces a concentrated supplier market with approximately 3-4 major chassis manufacturers and 2-3 primary engine providers for school buses and commercial vehicles.

**Table 1: Supplier Categories**

|Supplier Category|Number of Key Suppliers|Market Concentration|
|---|---|---|
|Chassis Manufacturers|3-4|High|
|Engine Providers|2-3|Very High|
|Semiconductor Suppliers|4-5|Moderate|

### High Dependency on Key Suppliers

Blue Bird's supplier dependency is critical, with approximately **==65-70% of component costs tied to top-tier suppliers**.== (they have long term contract with due date of 30th, +couple "exclusive" one)

- Chassis supply dependency: 45-50%
- Engine component dependency: 20-25%
- Electrical systems dependency: 15-20%(**Very good**)

### Supply Chain Disruption Risks

In 2023, semiconductor shortages impacted 12-15% of Blue Bird's production capacity, with raw material price fluctuations increasing component costs by 8-10%.

**Table 2: Supply Chain Disruptions**

| Disruption Type         | Impact Percentage | Cost Increase |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Semiconductor Shortage  | 12-15%            | 7-9%          |
| Raw Material Volatility | 8-10%             | 5-7%          |

### Capital Investments in Supplier Relationships
