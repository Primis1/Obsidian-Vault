### Basic materials - by definition is a commodity business where firms are price takers. Product is identical, thus they have no switching, pricing power
- Main source of advantage is **cost advantage**, i.e who may deliver the same bag of sand faster or cheaper
- Although, high capital investments may prevent from increasing competition, however low margins **also prevent any reasonable profits**
	- +High depreciation of facilities, provides cyclical entry points for new competition. I.e new entrances will more easily build state-of-the-art facility
- It refers to both, up & low stream businesses. Margins in different parts of value chain vary but frankly economic prospects look the same for entire sector
- ##### Copy-paste approach leaves little room for wide economic moat. Any R&D advantage can be replicated, however due to slow cash-cycle it can make mid term(5-10 years) economic profits

##### ##### Key Considerations:
- Does company have **a) low production costs? b) low capital costs? c) costs per unit of capacity or price-per-unit**
- Does firm benefit from geographic exposure or tech-process that can be replicated?
- Does firm effectively manages its balance sheet?

#### Study - BASF 
- Company possess the cost advantage and intangible assets. Made by their hard-to-replicate production process and scale 
	- Builds its production facilities close to one another it saves money on: transportation, energy and **materials(finished outputs can flow as inputs into another cluster)**
		- It may produce over 160 chemical products within single facility 
	- R&D investments and patents also benefit company. It shifted its production from basic chemicals into specialty chemies, where it can charge higher margins(also remember patents on those chemicals)
- Despite cost and intangible advantage, in far future those processes will be replicated, thus narrow economic moat is more suitable for such business

### Consumers - cost advantage(achieved through bargaining power before suppliers and consumers), strong brand names and scale advantage(with small to mid size growth and investment opportunities accelerate)
- Discretionary and durables have different revenue beta to GDP, CD prioritizes brand names and differentiation while staples cost advantage  
- Also Consumer products benefit from large scale, through more recognizable brand name, bargaining power with suppliers and production costs

##### ##### Key Considerations: 
- What are brand strength within company **portfolio**? Volumes and pricing are key indicators
- Does large scale enable company to lower its cost of production, through economies of scale/scope or through cost sharing and more efficient distribution?
- What's with private labeled competition?
- What is the rate of M&As? Large goodwill should not prevent companies from generating economic profits

#### Study - Pet-Smart
- Largest specialty retailer which benefits from its scale, 8-10% cheaper than other retailers
- Through its scale, own large quantity of services and products
	- That replication won't be economically **feasible** for competitors(**moat**)
- Operates for/with higher income clients - i.e its products aren't substantial part of consumer's cost structure
- Secured contracts with premium vendors, thus pushed away competition for premium customers

### Energy - highly volatile sector dependent on geopolitical tensions and commodity prices
- Moat is gained primary through cost advantages and scale(some businesses may influence entire regions), through bargaining power and access to cheaper materials 
- Always-aging assets; rigs, shrinking basins and in some segment scrutiny of good crew(high level engies) indicate a highly competitive field, with low **rewarding** technological advancement
- Industry is highly competitive and posses low margins +high upfront investment === **efficient scale advantage is pivotal for sector in general**
##### ##### Key Considerations:
- Dept ratio? Due to cyclicity, downturn of economic cycle can kill highly leveraged energy company
- Three dimensions:
	- resource potential(2P AND 3P)
	- per unit production costs 
	- realized price(gas vs oil mix)
- Access to cheap material and high quality human capital for some industries 
- Regulatory barriers to entry, and advantage of scale
#### Study - Transocean
- largest ultra deep water driller. Attracts best talent and operates in niche field with intense competition, however through R&D(also patents) is the **leader in industry and dictator of industry standards**

### Financial Services - provide largely undifferentiated products(thus flux pricing flexibility), with cyclicity depended on interest rates(or M1 and M2 supplies) and unemployment. Can benefit from network effect(credit cards and similar services) 
- Commodity like service may posses a switching costs through insignificant difference between its peers and high complexity of switching between banks
	- The more services fin-inst provides the higher are switching cost
- Majority of moats are created cost advantage. However institutions may provide different degree of customer relationship and access to banks's tool box varies between them(*features are accessible on different cash levels*) 
- Uncertainty of capital markets and mispricing of underlying assets **doesnt allow to earn a wide economic moat for most fin-inst**

##### ##### Key Considerations: 
- What is the nature of its assets and liabilities? Thus risk associated with them
- Does firm benefit from network effect? 
	- Does company successfully competes for the premium clients? **In that race brand name and sustainability record are crucial**
- Does new regulation can threaten current business line?
- Does it earn above average return or **leverage or capital?**

### Health care - sector with high barriers to entry, conservative clients which rely highly on intangible(brand names +patents) and R&D pipeline. Within B2B services sticky switching costs
- Width of moat depends highly on diversification of product pipelines. Through capture of higher variety of consumer and also cost-sharing for R&D and distribution
##### ##### Key Considerations: 
- How strong is company's ability to develop new medicine and secure patents(**R&D success**)? What is historical risk of failing the test-trial?
- What percentage of income comes from **hard-to-develop drugs?** Vaccines and biologics are protected not just by patent, but also by regulatory **fences** and complexity of R&D
- Can firm successfully convert one product into line of others?
- How attractive is therapeutic area?  
#### Study - J&J
- Large scale and leadership the opens the door to
	- Efficient cost sharing 
	- Strong brand name 
	- Variety of product lines creates diversification and protects from sales concentration 
- Unlike its competitors, created strong R&D pipeline and thus upcoming patents, which will secure its position for years to come
- In pair with 70% margin on its products, J&S earns wide economic moat

### Industrial - broad sector with tons of industries, every of which may poses an economic moat
- In broad industrials, having highly leveraging core, which manages other segments of business is crucial
- Large portfolio of services may enhance margins through cost sharing, however, in most cases stand-alone entitles  may **worth more than entire business web**

##### Key Considerations: 
- In conglomerates, or diversified industrial, which segment are more valuable as stand-alone entities? 
	- How one segment, complements another?
- Does company divesting(selling) businesses in the same rate that it acquires it?
- What is success score for firm acquisitions? Is it destroying value and management capacity?

### Technology - fast moving and highly uncertain sector. Continuous improvements and value enhancing services and products. Highly scalable but dependent on client preferences and product life cycle
- Business model which embeds a switching costs(**renewal rate**) is crucial for short-life products 
- Two layers of switching costs:
	- Software + Hardware
- Network effect is a key source for majority of software products; **Users choose to use *that product* to ensure compatibility with other** or **developers develop product with compatibility in mind to gain access to *that market***

##### Key Considerations:
- What aspects of product line(entire ecosystem) helps it retain or gain consumer loyalty?
	- Consider breadth of current customer base, and figure its willingness to switch to substitute service? 
	- Does product/service is in **mission-critical segment?** 
- Does the firm is **a) mass market or b) premium class targeted?**
- What is breadth of services provided in one package? Can it generate a switching costs?
- **Longevity of customer relationship?**
- **What are startup costs? Is it a barrier to entry?**

- **For Hardware systems:**
	- In enterprise, replicate product is easy, thus switching costs are main source of advantage in with cost advantage
	1. ***Vendors build software ecosystem into hardware***
	2. Expanding life cycle. Enabling customization, repair and modularity(buying new GPUs to existing cluster)
		1. Also minimize migration costs for new *firm's products*
	3. Annual maintenance 

- *Do competitors focused on gaining market share, enhancing value or increasing profitability?*

#### Study - DOCU

### Utilities - for most history were owned by government. Policies dictate the price and demand for utility services. Consolidated sector with little new entrances(efficient scale) and low margin 
- Majority of firms *may* generate its WACC in the long run
