### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Basic materials - by definition is a commodity business where firms are price takers. Product is identical, thus they have no switching, pricing power
- Main source of advantage is **cost advantage**, i.e who may deliver the same bag of sand faster or cheaper
- Although, high capital investments may prevent from increasing competition, however low margins **also prevent any reasonable profits**
	- +High depreciation of facilities, provides cyclical entry points for new competition. I.e new entrances will more easily build state-of-the-art facility
- It refers to both, up & low stream businesses. Margins in different parts of value chain vary but frankly economic prospects look the same for entire sector
- ##### Copy-paste approach leaves little room for wide economic moat. Any R&D advantage can be replicated, however due to slow cash-cycle it can make mid term(5-10 years) economic profits

##### Questions:
- Does company have **a) low production costs? b) low capital costs? c) costs per unit of capacity or price-per-unit**
- Does firm benefit from geographic exposure or tech-process that can be replicated?
- Does firm effectively manages its balance sheet?

#### Study - BASF 
- Company possess the cost advantage and intangible assets. Made by their hard-to-replicate production process and scale 
	- Builds its production facilities close to one another it saves money on: transportation, energy and **materials(finished outputs can flow as inputs into another cluster)**
		- It may produce over 160 chemical products within single facility 
	- R&D investments and patents also benefit company. It shifted its production from basic chemicals into specialty chemies, where it can charge higher margins(also remember patents on those chemicals)
- Despite cost and intangible advantage, in far future those processes will be replicated, thus narrow economic moat is more suitable for such business
