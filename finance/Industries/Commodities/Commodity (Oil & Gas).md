### Special values:
1. #BOE - barrels of oil equivalent; energy contained in **1** barrel of oil = 1,700 kilowatt-hours (kWh)
	1. By industry stands and simplicity, appliable for gas; *1 barrel of oil = 6000 cubic feet of natural* 
2. #MCF - gas **thousands cubic per feet**; 1 **mcf** = 1/6 energy of #BOE; hence 1 barrels of oil equivalent = 6 mcf's 
3. #commodity - basic material, which fundamentally;  commodities not have any specific size or shape; it depends only time and place where they were obtained

4. #source-curse - statement, that economy with large reserves of nat-commodities growth slower than the ==resource scare== economies. ***Volatility of Intrinsic value of nat-resources majorly impacts overall volatility of the country***   
### Concepts:

#### Key characteristics 
- Delivered globally, by sea, usually **in bulk/масса(оптом)**

- Volatile Oil Window - range and temperature condition in subsurface oil reservoir,  ***hydrocarbons***(energy chemicals in oil and gas). 
	- Reservoir contains significant amount of pressured natural gas, which released on a surface, **to the lower pressure** 
	- Such windows contain high Gas-To-Oil proportion 
	- **Oil is lighter in such reservoirs**, due to amount of hydrocarbons 

- Scale economy favor bulk deliver. Cost of transportation makes location - **significant** price-factor

- #commodity with similar **physical** characteristics are exchangeable

- No premium for *brand*; price determined by product price and availability 

- Long storing periods, often infinite 

- Energy sector will continue to demand fossil fuels in this decade before decline. Meeting 40-60% of global energy demand up to 2050. 


#### Main types
- ##### Primary #commodity 
	- Raw materials obtained from farms, mines, wells
	- Fundamental and natural products without specific shape, size nor quality
- ##### Secondary #commodity
	- Processed raw materials used for specific business needs
		- *Crude oil -> gasoline
	* Only minor variations in quality

#### Pricing Pillars in Contracts
- **Where** - delivery location 
- **When** - delivery timing 
- **What** - product quantity 

#### Development of Commodities
- **OPEC** - The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
- Demand and market volatility on #commodity can hit a company's income. Therefore businesses invest money into storages, where they can hold their materials from wells

#### Refining into products 
- **Separation** - series of heated distillations towers with the bottom product in one tower fed into the top of the next tower
- **Conversion** - breaking up the carbon chain to get more **light products** 
- **Purification** - removal of sulfur  

#### Arbitrage - fluctuation in price between markets

*Example:*
- **Existing trade flows** - **`Trafigura`** arranged to source *copper* concentration via an off-take agreement with with mine 
	- I also agreed to deliver its *copper* to ***Finish*** smelter 

- **Transformation in space/Geographic arbitrage** - **`Trafigura`** identified arbitrage opportunity; switching buyers for Finish smelter to Spanish mine; 

- Finds another buyer for Peruvian mine (**US**);  

- *Copper delivered to Finland on time*, but **US** wants it faster, therefore ready to pay **premium**; **Stores** Peruvian concentrate at an **Impala** **Terminals warehouse**

- US requires specific type of concentrate, trading company manufactures in its storage (**Impala** **Terminals warehouse**), earns additional margin and ships concentrate to US buyer

#### Facts:
- Rapid growth in Chinese demand changed the structure of metals and minerals trading
- Producing nations took back control of their oil assets
- Canada 4# producer of oil, *5.76 million barrels per day*

`CAPP.ca`
- Canada is the United States’ largest foreign **crude oil supplier**, making up ~60% of all United States imports
- Canada exported roughly 45% of its natural **gas** supply to the United States
	- From 2010 to 2021, natural gas exports to the US decreased by 18% due to increased natural gas production in the northeast US


### Business Segments

#### Upstream - those whose expenses are in E&P(Exploration & Production) sectors of Oil&Gas industry
- Seek the underground and undersea reserves of liquids 

#### Midstream - gathering systems which collect oil from wells and distribute
- Pipelines, ENB for example 

#### Downstream - commodity refining sector
- Processing raw liquids into consumable materials; then selling it to people/business
- May produce gasoline and jet fuel, for example 


### Valuation Factors

#### Upstream segment:
- Primary assets are - reserves.

- Proven 
	- Volumes of oil/gas that are recoverable in future years from knows reservoirs, under current economic/operating conditions 
- Unproven 
	- Has 50% chance of having ==higher== reserves quantities 
	- Has 50% chance of having ==lower== reserves quantities 

*Quote: **"Possible reserves (referred to as 3P reserves when aggregated with proved and probable reserves) ==have a 10==% probability that reserves quantities are higher than estimated and a ==90% probability that reserves quantities will be lower== than estimated."*** 

##### To estimate future value of Upstream; we should estimate future value of reserves!
- Formula for E&P company:

$$V=∑(Qi​×Pi​−Oi​−Ci​)×Di​+NA$$
Where:

- $Qi$​ = Net reserves (quantity) for period iii
- $Pi = Estimated future price per unit for period iii
- $Oi$​ = Operating expenses for period iii
- $Ci$​ = Capital expenditures for period iii
- $Di$​ = Discount factor for period iii (based on discount rate)
- $NA$ = Net asset value (market value of other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet)

##### To estimate future value of Downstream(manufacturer); we should estimate future gross margin on products!
- Lower price on commodity - benefits downstream business, unlike upstream 
- Crack - spread in the differential between the price of crude oil and price of petroleum products **extracted** from it
- The heavier oil, the harder to get a refined product such as gasoline; *lower **crack** spread*
