### Special values:
1. first-party data - collected directly by the website from its own users 

2. second-party data - another's company first-party data **shared** through partnership 

3. third-party data - purchased or acquired from someone who is not related to the website where data was taken  
4. `GDPR`  - General Data Protection Regulation(**EU**)
5. **`CCPA`** - California Consumer Privacy Act(**US**)


### Concepts:

##### "*The more connected a data set is to other data elements, the more valuable it is*"
- With recent privacy policies, collecting and then selling/using **cross-site** data by #cookies won't be legal/possible
	- *Regulations should be in full power at the end of 2024, that restricts usage of third-party #cookies, therefore companies should seek alternative to continue marketing campaigns*  

"Open internet becomes private again... **or no**?"

##### Big-Data develops alternative to TPC which will comply with user's privacy
- **Google's Privacy Sandbox** - Includes alternatives like Topics API
- **Unified ID 2.0**(TTD) - Privacy-focused identifiers (e.g., UID 2.0) allow tracking without third-party cookies.
- **Server-Side Tracking** - Moves tracking from the browser to the backend, reducing reliance on client-side cookies
- **First/Second Party agreements** - share of data between non-competitive entities

*a manufacturer of consumer products could partner with an e-commerce retailer to combine browsing-history data with shopping-cart data*

#### Policies & Regulations 
- Lack of compliance with GDPR and CCPA
	- Transparency - users are **unaware** of extend to which **their** data is collected, shared and sold **across websites*
	- Privacy invasion - track users cross-web, creating precise profile in center database
***Continued by uncontrolled data share***

- **Consent-based** data collection will replace cookie-based approach 

- #### Persistent Identifiers:
	**The Trade Desk**, Zeotap, and other players are working to **establish universal IDs**, anchored by identifiers such as email addresses.
	
	**Daniel Heer, founder and CEO of Zeotap** : “***universal ID functions as a master first-party** ‘**cookie**’ but one that is persistent and valid across all data-collection (and activation) channels*. This ID can then be used for relevant second- or third-party-data enrichment and activation across a plethora of marketing channels, including the open web.”9 To be GDPR compliant, these solutions will need to ensure that consumers’ privacy choices, including explicit user consent, are respected."

- **Contextual advertising** - claimed for its inefficiency, however this can overlap with emerging technologies
	- Traditional CA is based on keywords, with new era of natural language recognition - let algorithms to grasp the meaning of website, hence displaying right ads  

#### Impact on supply chain:
- **Technology & Platforms** - Without third-party cookies, advertisers lose granular cross-site behavioral data, making targeting less precise. They must rely more on first-party data, contextual advertising, and new identity solutions.

- **Publishers** - providing content in exchange for personal data. Even more aggressive campaigns to grasp data to enable creation of user-profiles
	- Major players rely less on third-party **due to built users' images**(**Meta, Google, Amazon**), unlike smaller one (lead to painful infrastructure development) 

- **Retailers** - traditional platform for brands to sells their goods. Future **powerhouse** of **first-party data**
