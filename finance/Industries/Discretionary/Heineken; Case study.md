### Terms Recognition:
1. 

### Concepts:

#### Steps 
1. Take a broader view at the industry value chain.
	1. What segments have the biggest margins? What is targets exposure to them and what **are threats?**
	2. Which are emerging or in disruption? Current economic/consumer pressure?
	3. Key players?
		1. **`Maybe switch analysis target?`** 
2. Recognize industry structure. Core competitors in region 
	1. Identify deviation of revenue. How many comes from NA, Europe, etc
	2. What competitors it faces there?
		1. **`Maybe switch analysis target?`**

3. Complete overview of industry development and its current state 
	1. Key growth metrics; `over last 5 years, beer consumption grew by 4.3% annually. Growth for next 5 years is 2.6%` 
	2. Regions of those growth. Is it in developed or emerging markets? Does growth aligns with business core regions?
	- #### Industry risks? When does it perform well? 

4. Reorganize fin statements 
5. Start Growth and ROIC analysis
	1. How much growth is organic(volume and price-per-unit) and through acquisitions
	- ##### Peer comparison - difference in value between peers should be explained by ROIC  

#### Management decision:
1. In endeavor to consolidate its industry, Heineken purchased 40% of its competitor 

### Income Statement:
1. `D&A` - should be separated into D and A. and A should be divided into operating and non-operating 
2. `Other Income` - include gain/loss from sale of assets - classify it as non-operating
3. `COGS` - include all raw materials, but we should exclude 219 m 2007 fine from EC and 16 m loss on disposals in 2008
4. `Personnel Exoenses` - exclude pensions and addition to non-operating provision

#### Each of non-operating income/expense should be separated into non-operating item elsewhere on reorganized sheet


### Balance Sheet 
1. `Trade and other receivables` - Heineken included hedging derivatives
	1. Financial derivatives should be excluded from **invested capital**. 
2. `Other investments` - assets which are held for sale, advances to customers, are NO 
3. `Trade and other payable` - include items such as 
	1. **hedge derivatives**
	2. **dividends**
	3. **interest payable**
	4. **trade payable****
	5. **other operating liabilities**
	6. **accruals and deferred income**
	
	- Add short term tax liabilities to **other current operating liabilities**

4. Intangible - separate into operating(software, subscriptions) and goodwill
5. Provisions - non-operating, consist mainly from restructuring costs

6. `Investment in goodwill` = change in goodwill from last year +add back write offs and amortization(not required by new standards)

### Historical Performance
- Drop in ROIC within consolidating industry may be explained by large acquisitions 
- We can **project capital structure by** historical standards(in case of fin-distress, hard to imagine exact D/E ratio, thus check what it was before distress)
- `Market value of debt`

#### Cost of Equity/Debt -> WACC

#### DCF

### Enterprise value 

### Probability and utility
- Take up several, more likely, scenarios. 
	- Continue aggressive acquisitions
	- Focus on improving existing performance
	- Operating as usual
