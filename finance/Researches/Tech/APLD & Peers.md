- **Main Competitors:**
    
- **Competitive Advantages (Moat):** in favor of sector leaders(NVIDIA who holds 4% stake +"Related Companies" reel estate group)

- Transitions into HPC, since 2023, indicate diversification in compare to peers/competitors 
### **6. Risks**

- **Industry-Specific Risks:** possible bubble, cyclical industry in cyclical sector
- **Regulatory or Legal Risks:** environmental restrictions, electricity roof, physical asset development(**rather good, because it's more understandable**)

	- two additional clusters to our Cloud Services Business, increasing the total to six clusters, each containing 1,024 GPUs

- **Expansion Plans:** 
	- expecting to open additional cluster after Q2(Jan 14), hence experience higher expenses and negative #net-income 
	- Expecting to increase "electricity roof", what will lead to higher supply and solve main issue of industry. Builds renewable energy sources and makes contracts with hyperscalers 

- **Sector Trends Favoring the Company:** considered an undervalued investment by most analysts

### **8. Management**
- Some seasoned workers. Most executives have financial experience. Other half are technicians who actually know what they're doing 
- Over 200 employees
