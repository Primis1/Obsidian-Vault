1. Basic description 
	1. Kaspi (KSPI) is Kazakhstan’s largest fintech + retail super-app. Over 20 years it evolved from a bank into a marketplace/financial ecosystem (Payments, Marketplace, Lending). Founders/insiders (Kim & Mikhail) hold ~44%. Primary operations are Kazakhstan-centric with nascent expansion abroad

2. Valuation & profitability snapshot: **P/E 6.8;  P/B 3.6; EV/EBITDA ~6x. EBITDA margin ~37%, NI margin ~29%, ROE ~68%, WACC(current): 13.4%*. Management guides NI +20% (Q2 results, achieved guidance despite macro hurdles)

3. Background 
	1. Regional shocks (Ukraine war) and capital flight, combined with a damaging short-report and policy-driven smartphone disruptions, pressured the share price. A large Turkey acquisition paused payouts — funded largely from FCF — which discouraged income-focused investors
	

4. Macro
	1. Kazakhstan: favorable demographics and ~5% GDP growth, but recent Tenge weakness, tariffs and strong demand pushed inflation ~12% (target 6–8%).  
	
	2. Turkey: larger addressable market but higher macro volatility; inflation and rates are easing but remain elevated (CB targets ~16–20% by end-2026
5. Business segment overview
	- **Fintech (≈48% revenue):** consumer/business loans, deposits, BNPL and merchant working capital — high margin, data-driven lending.
    
	- **Marketplace (≈28%):** 3P e-commerce (expanding into groceries, auto, travel); embedded fintech and ad products.
    
	- **Payments (≈23%):** P2P, POS/QR, merchant integrations and B2B services that monetize platform activity.  
	
    - Non-monetized government services support engagement and confirm "consumer-first" 


6. Statements + Yields
	1. Capital & payouts: Kaspi runs an **asset-light, low-leverage model**, funding expansion mainly from FCF; the €650 m (6.25%) Hepsiburada debt is an exception. Its strength lies in **monetizing users across verticals** — converting a single marketplace customer into payment, lending, and deposit activity; it took €650m debt (with 6.5% int.) for the Hepsiburada deal(+plans to invest 300m in the future)
	
	2. Pre-acquisition cash returns (dividends + buybacks) were ~3.4–6.1% SY. Post-deal liquidity remains healthy (≈$2b cash)
7. Moving Forward plans; Expansions 
	1. Expansion strategy: Kaspi acquired a majority stake in Hepsiburada, aiming to enhance its operations and app performance by providing funding and technical expertise — not by merging user interfaces. Brands will remain distinct with possible fintech+payment integration
	
	2. The planned acquisition of Turkish Rabobank (bank license) will enable local fintech operations
	
	3. My hunch: after successful horizontal and then vertical expansion for Fintech and Marketplace, there will be third acquisition/launch for payment direction business
	
	4. Management’s goal appears to be replicating Kaspi’s ecosystem in Turkey through horizontal marketplace and fintech expansion, rather than migrating the Kazakh super-app itself


8. Thesis - Current short–mid term macro headwinds, combined with a short-report and the region’s perceived geopolitical risk, have placed unjustified pressure on the stock. Kaspi remains undervalued relative to its core business quality and earnings power.
	
    - Smartphone registration/tariff changes temporarily depressed marketplace demand; recovery is likely within a few quarters. Meanwhile, Kaspi has sustained vertical expansion and capital return discipline historically, with strong bottom-up growth (TPV/GMV/AMU) and rapid path to profitability in new verticals

9. Valuation:
	1. Kaspi is a hybrid of fintech and e-commerce, complicating valuation. For this report, I use an intuitive, simplified PV approach based on net income. A full FCF, DCF-to-equity, or segment-by-segment model (including HEPS) would overcomplicate the analysis without adding proportionate insight compared to a straightforward sensitivity range of PVs under varying discount rates

 *"It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong"*

- A 5-year DCF without a terminal phase, assuming 20% annual growth and a 26% discount rate (WACC × inflation adjustment), yields a present value of ~\$8.7B vs. current market cap of ~\$14B.


- Extending the model with a 4% terminal growth rate (overly conservative) and maintaining the same 26% discount rate increases total equity value to ~\$15B. Including the firm’s current equity base (~\$3.9B) implies an intrinsic value near \$19B.

- Under moderate macro normalization — easing inflation and gradual conflict resolution — intrinsic value could approach **~$22B**, driven by a stronger PV phase(high interest rate env also constrains fintech growth & profitability) and lower discount-rate assumptions.
- Still, the thesis doesn’t rely on macro recovery — it’s grounded in execution. Over the past few years Kaspi expanded horizontally and vertically across all segments, proving its ability to grow and sustain profitability even in a **challenging environment**

- The thesis doesn’t rely on macro recovery — it’s grounded in execution. Kaspi’s fundamentals justify an intrinsic value near **$17–19B** even under current headwinds, with potential to reach **~$22B** as inflation and rates normalize, easing valuation pressure and improving fintech margins. 
- Target price range 97-108.3. I personally put it to 104.6

Waiting to discuss it, answer questions and receive criticism, thanks for reading and effort put in future discussions 

*For number crunchers, ready provide inputs in comments if anyone will ask for it*


If data available in quarters(q2 instead of full year), take QoQ rate from this year reports, expand it with with the same rate for complete year, adjust it if needed, and then start working per-annual basis
