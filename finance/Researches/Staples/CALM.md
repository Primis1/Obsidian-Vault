### Special values:



#### 1. Company Description
1. Cal-Main Foods is the largest American egg-product producer(about product split later). It was founded more tahn 50 years ago, and since than expanded its operations into X states. Was and remain a family owned business with board members holding shares in an enterprise  
Note: Details and numbers 


#### 2. Industry Background
1. Eggs - staple product that, however, has direct relationship to commodity prices(aka eggs itself and feed costs). Due to fragility and short shelf live export overseas or even between states is difficult, which provides barrier to entry from international firms however *lowers* it in the same time - farms and small family businesses still constitute majority of the industry. Therefore, even now it remain segmented industry, with CALM holding 14% of entire flock in US, twice as much as second competitor. 

2. Another "trend" is mandatory shift towards cage-free chickens that was imposed by government. In theory, transition have to finish by 2030, but deadlines were softened due to HPAI and bird flu outbreaks that cut hen population. 

3. To summarize - segmented, low-margin, slowly consolidating, essential commodity business.   
 
#### 3. Trends related to business
1. Egg production is mainly local dynamics. If egg prices, for whatever reason, slide 50% in Germany, it will have no effect on US & Canadian Market, thanks to reason described in "Industry Background". ~~However virus outbreaks are impossible to predict and hard to contain, as was described in conference calls and article on - HPAI epidemic was gradual, unlike bird flu which hit and disappeared within few month.~~ 

Note: Garbage above 

2. However, trade relations do influence egg's COGS. Feed, corn and soy beans specifically, trading at 5 year lows, with US harvesting enough to trade globally. I am not intend speculate about prices of commodities which are not within scope of this research, however i will leave a note from CALM's management:

"Current indications for corn and soybean project a favorable stocks-to-use ratio for us near the levels prevailing today for the remainder of fiscal 2026; however, as long as outside factors remain uncertain (including trade and tariff negotiations, weather patterns and global supply chain disruptions), volatility could remain" - Fiscal Q1 2026

3. Other than commodity prices and viruses, i may add additional, subjective, trend for egg consumption: aging population and overweight treatment. First point is self-explanatory, specialty eggs are recommended to everyone of every age, however seniors consume much more "whites" thanks tot more active visits to the doctor. Secondly, weight loss drugs, specifically Ozempic. Novo Nordisk managed to get approval for ***pills***, and Eli Lilly plans to develop another one this year. 
4. Why did i brough up drugs? Simple - with higher tolerance to pills and rising fat population people who undergo treatment **must** sustain high protein diet to go through stages successfully. That can additional 50-150 basis points on top of population growth to growth in YoY egg consumption

#### 4. Business Verticals:
1. Eggs:
	1. Conventional 
	2. Specialty
2. Prepared Foods 
	1. high protein products 

3. Vertical integration 
#### 5. Financials 
- No-debt, acquisitions funded mainly through cash reserves. Throughout downward spiral for egg prices calm digs into it's cash reserves, it happened at ==2016== and ==2020==. I understand their strategy over last 20 years as: capitalize on spikes in prices -> build cash cushion to withstand 1-2 years of overcapacity -> start new cycle with larger scale(horizontal & vertical) and expanded product portfolio(acquisitions). Standard commodities... except in recent years CALM diversifies into much more stable specialty and prepared foods lines (last 2-qs price for regular eggs drops by ~50% while specialty barely changed) that currently holds 50% of the total revenue(prepared foods + specialty eggs)


#### 6. Moving forward 
1. Based on egg prices, consumer demand and recent acquisitions, i expect:
	1. Investments into prepared foods & its integration into 

#### 7. Advantages 
1. Largest producer who continues to consolidate the industry 
2. Vertical integration, has it's distribution and packaging network +owns labeled eggs
3. Expanding into prepared egg products. Leverage it's vertical integration with input supplies 
4. Thanks to changed product mix expected cash burndown should be lesser than in any other "cheap eggs" years 

#### 8. Thesis & Valuation 
1. Best time to invest into commodity business is to pick group leader that can survive the bad times and purchase stake in it when they start to dip into it's cash reserves. At time of negative FCF, aka when egg prices are lowest, stock experience downward pressure from analyst and dividend investor(never believe that dividend are not bonds, therefore can be cut). By doing simple DCF to firm or equity(CALM carries no debt although has tiny amount of interest expense) *assuming that average price per dozen is ~2$ **sold** for next 5 years* with reasonable reinvestments(reasonable because management will continue to pour money into prepared foods and specialty eggs) we get 32-36$ per share **for first 5 years** 

2. Why so low? For short - reinvestment. They successfully capitalized on its assets during upward cycle, however if they will continue to grow on unit by unit basis(implied that egg consumption per capita will grow organically 3%). Capturing share from competitors and tailwind from consumers. However that growth will **destroy value** due to depressed prices. The most reasonable solution, as i see it, to invest into specialty eggs(which prices are mostly capped) & prepared foods  have higher general margins 

#### **Closing Remarks / Conclusion **
