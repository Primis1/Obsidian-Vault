### Special values:

### Concepts:

### Value Creation: 
#### Value - *sum of present values of future cash*-*flows*

##### Business which does decisions in regardless of building value, and in favor of "good statistics" -> bad business. ==E.g anything that doesn't increase cash-flow, doesn't increase value== 
#### Growth, Cash Flow, ROIC - the less company have to invest to generate profit/expand, the better is cash-flow, the better cash-flow, the better growth

#### Alternative P/E - divide calculated value on its earnings 

#### High ROIC should focus on growth, and moderate/low ROIC on ROIC increase before growing

#### Different sources of revenue growth give different values:
- Introducing new product - 1.75-2 value
- Expand existing market - 0.30-75 value
- Increase in share growing market - 0.10-0.50
- Acquire businesses - 0.20-20 

*In dollars to revenue

* * Again, everything that doesn't increase cash flow != value 
* * *It does not account risk of failure, launched to the market product can be rejected/unsuccessful 

### Value measuring and Interpretation 

### Value Creation - FCF discounted by (WACC - growth of income) = value that company generates
- #### Acknowledgement:
	- *Considering that value are things that create cash, we should consider hazards/improvements in revenue margins, costs of capital and room for growth. These things are determined by business models. Hence DCF model can estimate value creation for next year by simply considering current value creation, therefore we should news and industry forecasts = to forecast future revenue growth, FCF and ROIC

### Growth 

#### Drivers of Growth:
1. Portfolio momentum - organic growth of revenue, archived by overall expansion in the market segment represented by its portfolio. 
	1. Through selective acquisition, expansions and creating new markets for their products. They can expose their influence into shrinking and expanding markets
2. Market Share Performance - revenue growth/reduction, gained by share increase in market 
3. Mergers and Acquisitions - inorganic growth through buys or sells revenues through acquisitions or divestment 

- Growth on a level of individual products is more important, than the growth of entire company

#### Types of Growth:

Above average:
- Create new market through new products - hard/costly to replicate; no established competitors and high customer's demand 
- Convince to buy more product of existing line - low risk of retaliation, higher demand
- Attract new customers to the segment - low risk of retaliation, higher demand. Target new group of ppl

Medium:
- Gain market share in fast growing business 
- Make bolt-on acquisition to accelerate product 

Below average:
- Gain from rivals through incremental innovation / product promotion 
- Large acquisition 

Three characteristics: 
- no fight back from competitors
- high return on low/reasonable price
- sustainable positions acquired share 

#### Sustaining Growth:
- The larger you get, the tighter room of existing market growth is. If GDP growing 5%, the larger you get, the harder to get even bigger share in the market
