### Special values:

### Concepts:

#### Risk categories:
- Market risk - market's sentiments towards industry and how it influences the stock
- Credit  - risk of default. `Debt-to-Equity, interest coverage`
- Liquidity risk - volumes, easiness of buy/sell
- Operating - risk from business operations 

##### Equity & Volatility Risk 
- Historical Volatility - past market fluctuations; calculated by standard deviation
- Implied Volatility - forecasts of future volatility(derived from ***options pricing model***)

- Beta - correlation of stock movement to the general market (-1 opposite to the market, 2 twice as much)
- VIX - volatility, known as "fear index". Market's expectation of 30-day volatility and is constructed using the *implied volatility* of S&P 500 option index
- Risk premium - demand of higher returns for higher risk(mostly does not work)
- Leverage - increases the return/loss of an portfolio(*obviously*)

- CAPM - capital asset pricing model to calculate expected **asset** return relatively to its risk: $$ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i(E(R_m) - R_f) $$
	- where $E(R_i)$, $\beta_i$ is the beta of the investment, and $E(R_m)$ is the ==expected market return==


### Ratios:
- Current & Quick ratios - determines capability to pay-off its current liabilities

#### Sharp Ratio - $\frac{Rp​−Rf}{σp​}$ the higher the ratio, the smother return provided
- $Rp$​  - return of portfolio
- $Rf$​ - risk-free rate
- $σp​$ - standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return​(volatility)

	- SPY - 0.45 
	- Buffet - 0.74
	- Hedge Fund - 2+
- `High Sharp != Higher returns `
	- With **leverage**, invested in high sharp(low volatility) portfolio, getting better returns with less risk 


##### Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) function - value gains and loses from investment including market's sentiments
$$𝑈(𝑦) = \frac{1}{R}(1-e^{Ry})$$
- U(y) - utility
	- y - change in investors fin wealth 
	- R - coefficient of absolute risk. 
		- **Positive** - indicate risk-aversion; 
		- **negative** - risk seeking
	- 
#### Alpha - excess returns earned above benchmark, when adjusted to risk 
- Lower risk is a driver for alpha
- Alpha of 0, indicates same growth that index 

### SWOT - Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats
- Companies best qualities/best assets 
- Internal review of companies disadvantages/worst qualities 
- Opportunities for further expansion. What market can companies serve/improve, which still remain unserved? 
- External threats: market share, competitors, industry disasters 

Example:
- **Strengths:** Tesla has a strong position in the EV market because of its strong brand recognition as an industry pioneer. The company's advanced battery technology allows for superior range in its vehicles. Tesla's extensive Supercharger network also provides a significant advantage in terms of charging infrastructure
 
- **Weaknesses:** Tesla has struggled with production capacity limitations, often failing to meet demand and delivery targets.3 Quality control issues have also been a recurring problem from time to time. Tesla's vehicles are generally priced higher than those of competitors, which may limit market penetration in more price-sensitive regions.

- **Opportunities:** Tesla stands to benefit from the growing global demand for electric vehicles. The company has opportunities to expand beyond automotive into related fields such as energy storage and solar power, leveraging its battery expertise. The development of autonomous driving technology also presents another significant growth avenue, as Tesla has already begun implementing self-driving cars.4 Additionally, Tesla has the potential to tap into large, emerging markets like China and India where EV adoption could accelerate where it hasn't already.

- **Threats:** The competitive landscape for Tesla is intensifying as traditional automakers and new entrants invest heavily in electric vehicle technology. This increased competition could erode Tesla's market share and profit margins. Economic factors such as economic downturns could impact sales of Tesla's primarily luxury-oriented vehicles. The company also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions, particularly for critical materials used in battery production where it may already have manufacturing constraints.
