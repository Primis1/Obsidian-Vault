### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Understanding company's current valuation and what market discounts the stock
- If stock is cheap from #P/E , but not from anything else, ***maybe there is a specific tax-structure***
#### Owner's Yield - emphasize cash-flow, which cuts through any accounting issues
- Separates cash needed to **maintain current**, and those **growth** cash-flows which are needed for generating new streams $$\frac{\text{Cash Flow  - Maintenance CapEx + Glowth related expenses}}{Market Cap}$$
- It is a yield which can be compared to: 
	- Bond curve
	- Equity risk premium - spread between earnings yield(EPS/price) and risk free-rate(10-years T-bills)
- ##### Problems with leverage - Owner's Yield may fool, if we don't ==consistency and low leverage requirements==
	- Volatility of margins and seasonality should be taken into consideration(==capital structure==) 
	- **Debt level is mainly company- industry - specific metric** 

#### Problems with FCF - business with high yield does not guarantee a superior return, maybe the ==opposite==
- In emerging markets, what sense from the business which misses the opportunities to **invest in high ROIC CapEx** to sit ass on a cash pile, while competitors taking a good chunk of market?
- High CapEx which's related for further value creation **is superior**

- ##### Security selection should be based on ROIC, growth, CF from operations and ROE of ==new== projects
