### Terms Recognition:
- Debt(Third fcn meaning) - fixed claim on entreprice value 
- Main benefit of **optimal** capital structure are DTA from interest expenses
- Current Coverage ratio **reflects current credit risk**. If company concentrated in single product which soon reach its life cycle -> future(and current if predicted) credit rating will be low despite convenient CR  
### Concepts:

#### Low risk companies with consistent earnings, but low growth, may benefit the most from leverage
- Due to reliability and low risk of bankruptcy they may seek edge(the most beneficial) exposure to leverage
- ##### Types of assets are important as well, if business incorporates a lot of fungible(обменними) assets it uses its value to back up its debt for debtors in case of `Chapter 7`

#### Leverage may provide discipline for managers, but what's more likely are 
1. Missed opportunities(because debt has to be repaid) and possibility of financial distress; 
2. Which can lead to windows for competitors to overtake market share 
3. Unreliability/riskiness for suppliers; if company may bankrupt - suppliers require **upfront payment** 
4. Low leveraged companies not necessary posses a low risk on its debt(small buy shitty, in case of unstable cash-flows)

- #### However most mangers value flexibility over reduction in `cost of capital`, i.e tax shield 

#### Precise capital structure does ==not== bring extra shareholder's value(doesn't give a lot), however it does not related to companies in/after distress(CUK/CCL)
- In case of overleveging, principle payments will play as additional shareholder's yield contributor(transfer of wealth from debtor to equity holder) 

#### Interest coverage ratio/Debt coverage ratio - $Interest/EBITA$, second ratio is suitable if company uses substantial portion of short-term debt  

#### Probability of default is not linear, rather it slowly growths from AAA to B, and then spikes 


#### Types of leverage:
