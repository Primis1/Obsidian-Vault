### Terms Recognition:
- How to enter the position: 
	- Why did it fall? Is it because of short term event or sectors/economic instability?
	- If it has high P/E, will their market expect to shrink in near future? 
		- If yes, their **valuation will not be justified** and price will decrease 
	- It missed it's guidance and followed a sharp decline, it will **take time** for analysis to buy out - **in case its fundamentals haven't change over time(it became cheap for a reason)**
### Concepts:

#### Understanding company's current valuation and what market discounts the stock
- If stock is cheap from #P/E , but not from anything else, ***maybe there is a specific tax-structure***
#### Owner's Yield - emphasises cash-flow, which cuts through any accounting issues
- Separates cash needed to **maintain current**, and those **growth** cash-flows which are needed for generating new streams $$\frac{\text{Cash Flow  - Maintenance CapEx + Glowth related expenses}}{Market Cap}$$
- It is a yield which can be compared to: 
	- Bond curve
	- Equity risk premium - spread between earnings yield(EPS/price) and risk free-rate(10-years T-bills)
- ##### Problems with leverage - Owner's Yield may fool, if we don't ==consistency and low leverage requirements==
	- Volatility of margins and seasonality should be taken into consideration(==capital structure==) 
	- **Debt level is mainly company- industry - specific metric**
