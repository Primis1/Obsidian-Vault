### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Determine driver for each line item
- For majority of income statement, revenue is a key driver. Bottom up approach suggests to analyse existing and expanding customer base. 
	- Better marketing may improve Money-Spent/Customer, More customer --> More revenue per store
	- Cash and marketable securities on balance sheet --> interest income 
- Do all estimations in percentages and then convert it into values. Avoid using growth rates instead of ratios
	- It gives flexibility and clearer view on the company's performance 

#### Operating line items: 
- COGS --->  Revenue ---> COGS/Revenue  
- SG&A ---> Revenue ---> SG&A/Revenue 
- Depreciation ---> Prior Year PP&E ---> D/PP&E 

#### Non operating line items:
- Interest Expense ---> Total Debt ---> IE / Total Debt 

#### Forecast CapEx:
- Net PP&E$_{2010}$ - Net PP&E$_{2009}$ + Depreciation$_{2010}$ = CapEx 

#### Retained Earnings:
- Retained Earning$_{2009}$ + Net Income$_{2010}$ - Dividends Paid$_{2010}$


#### Duration - value stocks provide cash flows much sooner than growth stocks(majority of which justify their price and borrow money in exchange for *future cash*), thus small change into current interest/inflation rates will influence value and drastically influence growth
- Thus discount rate(or any other denominator) at each forecasting year influence value of growth stock more than it does
