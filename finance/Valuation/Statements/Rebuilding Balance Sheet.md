[[Operating Financing]]
### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Working Capital - total operating assets - total operating liabilities
- ==Working cash balance, trade account receivables, inventory, pretax expenses== (**reserves which are greater than operation need - cash and market securities are** - **excluded**) - ==account payable, accrued salaries, deferred revenue, income tax payable==(**interest bearing liabilities are NO, hence should be ignored**)

#### PP&E - its book value is ==always== included in operating assets

#### Goodwill - does not wear off with time, therefore amortization should be added upward to the value of goodwill(like asset and not expense on income statement)
- Value of equity from acquisition should be removed from purchase/asset value
- Simply add back all the amortization 
- Unrecorded goodwill(pooling accounting method)

#### Excess cash and marketable securities - determine the value of *operating cash*, and exclude NO cash from OP assets 
- Rule of thumb and statistic is that OP cash is defined as part of revenue, often 1-5%$$\text{Total Cash} - (Sales * 0.25) = \text{Non Operating Cash}$$
#### Tax loss carry forward - treat it as NOA

#### Total funds invested - invested capital + NOA  

### ROIC 
- Including goodwill - indicates ability to generate value over **acquisition premium**
- Excluding goodwill - indicates acquired(company) competitiveness 

#### Retirement liabilities and restructuring reserves - if company recognizes underfunding of their pension plan, it noted as NOL 

#### Deferred operating taxes - companies(often young), tend to pay less ==in cash== taxes than was noted in their balance sheet
