[[Operating Financing]]
### Terms Recognition:

- NOL - is deductible only in region where it's recognized
### Concepts:

#### Working Capital - total operating assets - total operating liabilities
- ==Working cash balance, trade account receivables, inventory, pretax expenses== (**reserves which are greater than operation need - cash and market securities are** - **excluded**) - ==account payable, accrued salaries, deferred revenue, income tax payable==(**interest bearing liabilities are NO, hence should be ignored**)

#### PP&E - its book value is ==always== included in operating assets

#### Goodwill - does not wear off with time, therefore amortization should be added upward to the value of goodwill(like asset and not expense on income statement)
- Value of equity from acquisition should be removed from purchase/asset value
- Simply add back all the amortization for acquired intangible and ==acquired intangibles itself as well==
- Unrecorded goodwill(pooling accounting method)

#### Excess cash and marketable securities - determine the value of *operating cash*, and exclude NO cash from OP assets 
- Rule of thumb and statistic is that OP cash is defined as part of revenue, often 1-5%, depending on industry and cyclicity $$\text{Total Cash} - (Sales * 0.25) = \text{Non Operating Cash}$$
#### Tax loss carry forward - treat it as NOA

#### Total funds invested - invested capital + NOA  

### ROIC 
- Including goodwill - indicates ability to generate value over **acquisition premium**
- Excluding goodwill - indicates acquired(company) competitiveness 
- Equity should ***not*** be considered as part of invested capital 

#### Retirement liabilities and restructuring reserves - if company recognizes underfunding of their pension plan, it noted as NOL 


#### Cash tax - mismatch between balance sheet taxes and tax statements that company files up to the government
##### Deferred operating taxes - companies(often young), tend to pay less ==in cash== taxes than was noted in their balance sheet

#### Deferred Tax Assets - future tax reduction
- Various tax-reduction expenses; pension plan, R&D, Interest expenses(including rent and leases) 

#### Deferred Tax Liabilities - future *expected*  tax payment
- May appear for deferred revenue or other income 
- $DTL - DTA = DTL$, what is left reduced/added to taxes which are paid this year

##### Tax loss carry-forward - is NON-operating DTA (what is left from NOL YoY)
##### Pension plans and benefits - in US expenses on that are tax deductible, but does not relate to value creation/revenue, thus such DTA should be excluded from operations
##### Nondeductible intangibles - when company acquires another company(thus its intangibles) it recognizes amortization on *indefinable or separable intangible assets*. However they are nondeductible for tax statements, thus should be treated as *NOA* 

* DTA and DTL are *not* considered as part of invested capital, because they are flowing through cash tax via NOPLAT, thus they are equity
