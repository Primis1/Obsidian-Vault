### Terms Recognition:

- #### ROIC $$\frac{NOPLAT}{\text{Invested Capital}}$$


### Concepts:

#### Problems with FCF - business with high yield does not guarantee a superior return, maybe the ==opposite==
- In emerging markets, what sense from the business which misses the opportunities to **invest in high ROIC CapEx** to sit ass on a cash pile, while competitors taking a good chunk of market?
- High CapEx which's related for further value creation **is superior**

- ##### Security selection should be based on ROIC, growth, CF from operations and ROE of ==new== projects

#### Operating & Non Operating Assets:
- Receivable
- Inventory 
- PP&E

- Marketable securities 
- Prepaid pension assets
- Non consolidated 
- Other long term investments which are not connected to business operations 

#### Operating & Non Operating Liabilities:
- Account payable 
- Accrued salaries 
- Interest bearing debt(note payable & long term debtor)

- Equity - common stock & retained earnings 

### Net Operating Income, Less Adjusted Taxes:
- Income available to *all investors, including debt holders*

- #### Interest is not subtracted 

- #### When calculating after tax *operating profit*, exclude ==any== non-operating income from assets that were excluded from ==invested capital==
	- *Including that will lead to inconsistency because of ROIC*   

- #### We want to isolate NOPLAT from capital structure(interest, taxes and tax deductions on `non operating income`), therefore we want remove taxes for non-operating interest expenses
	- ##### Operating taxes - reported taxes + tax shield from interest expenses - taxes paid on non-operating income 
		- resulted taxes should be equal to pure equity fueled company


	- ##### We start from EBITA, because depreciation is used for assets which handle economic value
		- +it excludes amortization which helps to avoid double pricing from re-investment into intangible and *amortization*
		- If company has one of EBIT or EBITDA, simply remove/add needed item and apply operating taxes to get NOPLAT
