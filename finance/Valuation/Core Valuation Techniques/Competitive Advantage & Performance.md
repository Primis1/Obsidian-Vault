[[Cost of Capital]]
***
### Terms Recognition:

- Any growth in cash-flow is driven by growth in revenue, therefore, we should analyze output and then evaluation expenses

### Concepts:

#### Decomposition of P/E 
- Company's P/E ratio is depended on future value creation(==confidence in that creation, i.e expectations==), **which is dependent on ROIC, Growth and ==Expected Growth== ***
- Business can only **a) do qualitative or b) quantitative expansions**
- Growth is a stream and ROIC is a bottleneck, which produce value. Influence on **a) market expansion or b) efficiency/margins c) certainty of future cash flows -> lesser growth & ROIC -> lesser P/E -> lesser divided value**

#### By decomposing ROIC we can analyze weak and strong points of company
- What can be improved as well as providing insights into it's operating strategies
- Ask: ***why*** numbers is like that in compare to peers?

##### For instance: 
- Home Depot's ROIC lagged in compare to Lowe's(8 vs 9%)
	- That happened due to operating margin, **which was lower to due to higher S&A expenses**, **which were due to more hired personal**, which, from conference call, should provide better customer experience and **possibly bigger sales**(that should be investigated during valuation)**
		- If company will succeed, it short-term sell off may provide a buying opportunities(however such detail should be valued quickly) 
		- Also from revenue turnover -> HD is more efficient, however, from notes we find that LW has newer stores which are more bargaining today but will be more efficient in the future


$$ROIC =\text{(1-Operating `Cash` Tax Rate)}* \frac{EBITA}{Revenue} * \frac{Revenue}{Invested Capital}$$

#### In research we should also find out key ==business measures(Available Seat-Miles, Price-per-Barrel, Quantity of customers)==, and then compute the measure for better peer comparison 


#### Illusion of ==currency effect==
- If international company earns revenue in one currency and it **strengthens** in compare to dollar(or weakens like we see with CAD), reports will look more optimistic than they are

#### M&A, firm will report all revenue of acquired company for the year 
- If acquirer buys business in June, it will recognize revenue since start of the year, *i.e since company didn't have control over it*
	- (6 / 12 * revenue in $ )
	- for the next year remove it in backwards
- By that we can estimate **consistent** revenue growth 

##### Leverage - magnifies the trends on its operational performance(ROIC)
- Increasing ROE is possible through both D/E and ROIC, however leverage adds additional *"beta"*/volatility which company may not survive 

#### CFROI - alternative to ROIC in case of company's uneven CapEx 

#### Unit and Driver analysis - by projection future revenue growth we may compute majority of line items, for good revenue forecast we should estimate companies revenue drivers(price, volume and sustainability of demand). For operating statistics we may use(for peer comparison; `Store vs Store`):
$$Revenue=\frac{Revenue}{Unit}*Unit$$
