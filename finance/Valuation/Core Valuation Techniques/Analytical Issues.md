### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Operating Leases:
- When company leases, it **does not record it as liability or asset**, instead it records rental charge(expense)
- Include value of lease as an operating asset, with corresponding debt recorded as line item 
	- *Otherwise company will look "capital light",  in compare to those which purchase assets*
$$\text{Asset Value = } \frac{\text{Rental Expense}}{k_d + \frac{1}{Asset-Life}}$$
- k_d - cost of debt



Our business is _businesses_ and target prices _on businesses_

Consider Simo's before reciprocal tariff price target of 75-80$ per share, with reduced gross margins of their main buyers(Gadgets and soon Industrial for which we have a great hope) we should not expect dramatic change in investment thesis(SIMO will suffer indirect effect), because  

- Only sales-market of SIMO is affected
- SIMO's controllers are commodities, but highly demanding(from both perspectives: required for memory chips to function and be equally advanced to keep up with new chip generations) commodities

We should check the chunk of US revenue in SIMO's largest buyers and then calculate their margin reduction +guidance from upcomming report season(if their production will reduce === demand on chips will be less === less revenue )
