### Value of Cash - cash does not destroys value, although it's return is lesser than WACC

#### Other assets - value of assets which are included into computation of cash flows(aka office building where traders are located) should not be added to the final estimate of equity/share 

#### Value of independent units is higher because it's easier to analyze 

#### Non-consolidated chunks(below 50%) are located below operating expenses

#### Most of the time people are double counting "other assets"
