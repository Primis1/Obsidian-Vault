### To estimate economies of scale, compare line item on number of units sold and revenue from them 
- You won't get a discount from utility company for having multiple stores 
- You will pay the same for each stuff member per location
- You can earn **more** per location, if you utilize hired stuff more efficiently(income/expense per m^2)
- Compare number of units with specific line item(Revenue/SG&A)

#### Growth equal reinvestment * ROIC 
- Company destroys more value than it gets in return(ROIC < WACC)
- Fundamental growth:
	- Earning per share:
		- Reinvestment - Retention ratio = Net Income * 1 - payout ratio 
		- Return on equity = NI / Book value of Equity 
	- Net income from non-cash assets:
		- Equity reinvestment rate = (Net Capex + Change in WC - change in debt) / NI
		- Non-Cash ROE = NI from non-cash assets / (Book value of equity - Cash) 
	- Operating Income:
		- Reinvestment rate = Total Reinvestments / OI 
		- ROIC 

#### You can get high ROE by doing great projects or by pumping up debt 

#### 'Adjusted' Expected Growth in Earning - substituting equity reinvestment into *real* reinvestment and excluding cash from equity 
- Net Income - Income from Cash 
- Equity reinvestment = Net Capex + Change in WC * 1-Debt Ratio / Net Income(above)
- Non Cash ROE = Net Income / BV of Equity - Cash 
- Expected Growth(in net income) = Equity reinvestment rate * Non-Cash ROE 

#### The same % of ROE has different value based on their reinvestment rate and payout ratio. 
- Coke can pay most of its profits in SY, while other firm may retain it to itself
