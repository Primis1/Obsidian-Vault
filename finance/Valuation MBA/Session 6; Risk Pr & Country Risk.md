### ERP is equivalent to Yield for fixed income securities. It vary based on return of stock relative to underlying earnings  

### Country risk premium is based on revenue & production. Base it on "incorporation" is bullshit 
- In some industries production has more weight than sales(Resource company has mines in Africa which market of sale irrelevant)
	- Gross margin is a tool to weight Revenue vs Production 
	- Mobility of production 
- #### Not give company its country risk premium, unless it does business 100% there 
- A lot of analysts measure companies on single country risk premiums. It opens market inefficiency for businesses which have, for instance 50% from EM, but is incorporated in US - it can be over or undervalued based on crisis in one or another country 

### Use implied Risk Premium as Indication of total valuation of stock market 

#### Low correlation between RP and RFR
