### Growth is a measure of reinvestment * ROC, Growth in perpetuity is determined by: 
- Industry Growth & Overall size
	- Given region and sub-industry 
	- GR as technology 

- Current Market Share 
	- Competitive advantage 
	- Industry economics(few big winners or segmented industry)
	- Current share (potential to take from someone else)


#### Target Margins
1. Target operating margins
	1. Unit economics 
	2. Scale economies 
	3. Competitors 
2. Pathway to profitability 
	1. Current operating margins 
	2. Profitability vs Growth 
	3. Business model 

#### The worse is starting position the steeper is path to target margins(in case of young company that takes field expansion approach)  

#### EoS and Profitability are great, however they earn benefit to consumer if practice is industry available 


#### Terminal Value g (growth):
1. Risk free rate = Expected inflation + Expected real interest rate
2. real interest rate = what borrowers agree to return to lenders in real goods/services 

3. Nominal GDP growth = expected inflation + expected Real Growth 
4. Real Growth = unit based production in the economy 

#### Connections between risk free rate and terminal growth rate should be consistent and if done correctly - cancel one another. 
1. We use low interest rate(low WACC) we should use **low perpetuity growth rate**

#### Most companies mature faster & in risky industries corporate cycle is shorter 


#### FCFE - for financial service companies or those with stable leverage ratios(regardless or high/low)

#### FCFF - for firms with too high/low leverage ratios, those who want to change it overtime, 
- For firms with partial info 
	- In all other cases when you want to
