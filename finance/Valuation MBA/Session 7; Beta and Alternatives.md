### Beta is relative risk measure. We can use earnings, debt volatility, other beta models, etc 

#### Leverage & Proportion of fixed cost relative to all costs influences beta. I.e during covid airlines have most its costs fixed, therefore their earnings plummeted. 
- Risk - inability/poor job in sustaining returns 

#### Unleveraged beta = pure business beta * (1 + (fixed/variable costs))

#### Levered Beta = UB * (1 + (1 - tax rate) *  (D/E Ratio) = 0.95 * (1 + (1-.34) * (.1895) = 1.07
