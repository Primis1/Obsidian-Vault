### In Ontario car insurance is issued by private insurers 

#### Insurance act in Ontario regulates:
1. Content of an insurance contract - IA requires certain details to be declared in every insurance contract 
	1. Parties - names of insurer/ed. Insured is first party, insurer second
	2. Policy period - start and expiry dates 
	3. Insurable interest - loss payable *to*?. Parties with insurable interest in property: banks, construction companies, etc
	4. Type of insurance and amount of coverage - numbers 
	5. Rate and premium charged - cost of insurance per unit (1$ per 1000$. 500k insurance = 500 units)
	6. Subject matter - object of insurance 
2. Removal coverage - loss should occur in specific location, if object moved elsewhere - no reimbursement. 
	1. **Insured Location**
	2. **Exceptions**: when moving object will prevent from further loss. Although insured can store items elsewhere, but only for period of 7 days 
	3. Amount of insurance available will be deducted by existing loss from insured location
***
... *Because it was not at the insured location at the time of the loss. And the stock will not be insured under his home insurance policy because he does not have insurable interest in his sister’s property.*

... *If repairs to the specified location are expected to take longer than seven days, the policy must be amended to provide coverage for the removed property while stored at the temporary location beyond the seven days provided in the policy.*
 ***
 3. Co-insurance & deductibles & Specific clauses
	 1. If such clauses exist it should be stated as: *“This policy contains a clause(s) that may limit the amount payable” printed or stamped on the policy*
4. Right of subrogation - loss that was inflicted to another person but compensated his personal insurance. Ex: fire from Paul burned Finn's house. Finn's insurance compensated a loss and then sued Paul?

5. Waiver of Term or Conditions - any change to the policy should be in writing and with signature 

6. Effect of Delivery - after policy deliver, even if premium wasn't paid, policy is in force if it was *promised* to pay 
7. Fire Peril:
	1. Basic coverage - fire, lightning, explosion of natural gas, coal or manufactured gas 
		1. Friendly fire - located in a place where it supposed to be; insurer won't pay for loss from such fire 
		2. Hostile fire - fire escaped from it's "proper" place or ignition was cause from outside 
	2. Exclusions (unless that causes fire and damage follows):
		1. Heat exclusion 
		2. Lightning damage to electrical devices or appliance exclusions 
			1. Electric currents other than lightning exclusions - sudden urges or reductions in the power supply 
		3. Radioactive material 
		4. War 
	3. Statutory conditions - outlines the duties of both parties(insured/r)

#### Statutory conditions - non-removable legislations 
1. misrepresentation
2. property of others - mostly insureds aren't responsible for loss of others 
3. Change in interest 
	1. Change of title under succession & bankruptcy 
	2. Mentally incapable by law 
	3. change of title by death 
4. Material change - increases/changes loss, arises after policy issue 
	1. *the insurance company must prove this change in operation was both (1) substantial and (2) continuing. Because the change was a one-time event (that is, not continuing), this loss would not be considered the result of a material change.*
	2. Material change can cause increase in premium or cancelation of policy, followed by return of premiums, if any
5. Termination - provides return of fund and 15 or 5 days notice period 
	1. When terminated from insured side - pro-rate refund 
	2. Short rate if terminated by insured 
6. Requirements after loss - document all claims under the policy 
7. Fraud 
8. Who may give notice of proof - if insured is away or can't provide proof, insurer entitled to a) know a reason and b) if reason is approved -> proof can be given by lawyer, friend or relative 
	- A policyholder who has deliberately caused a loss may refuse to make a claim if they become aware that submitting a proof of loss in this circumstance constitutes fraud and may result in criminal charges. Despite such a refusal, - **a mortgagee or other party with an insurable interest is generally entitled to collect in such instances and is permitted to file notice and proof of loss** - 
9. Salvage - property that could be saved through reasonable effort 
10. Entry, Control and Abandonment - after loss occurs, insurer has all rights to access and asses damaged property 
	1. Consent isn't required 
11. Appraisal - ask a third-party to value property/loss 
12. When loss is payable - payable within 60 days after completion of sufficient proof of loss 
13. Replacement - insurer can substitute / rebuild the damaged - followed by notice to do so within 30 days after receipt of the proof of loss 
14. Action - if insured is unsatisfied - he can sue insurer within 1 year after loss/damage occurs 
15. Notice 
	- Twenty-eight days after Joe received the registered letter, his industrial building burned to the ground. He filed a claim with ABC Insurance, who denied the claim, stating the policy had been legally cancelled and that the 15-day notice period had passed.
	- Joe sued ABC Insurance. **The judge ruled that the insurer did not cancel the policy correctly because the registered letter of termination was not sent to the address shown on the insurance policy**. The address on the policy is legally binding, and it will remain the location where the insurer provides coverage until it is officially updated to another.
