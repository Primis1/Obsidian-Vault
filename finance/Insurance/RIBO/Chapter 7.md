### Fuck Ups:
1. 7.8.8
***
### Commercial Insurance - highly specific, requires different underwriting for each object 

#### Habitational Insurance - houses/apartments. Based on *Basic Fire Policy*
- Then it evolved into **Named Peril Form**
- After that, again, evolved into **Comprehensive Policy Form** 

#### Comprehensive policy forms - standardize all policy requirements currently in use. 
- *Initially covers ALL RISKS, however due being expensive and availability of other coverage - exclusions or clauses are listed/added on the front page* 

- #### Components:
1. Form 
2. Location - Homeowner Policy forms automatically include coverage for all property within lines/borders of the construction 
	1. That may include a parking lot or dwelling the tenant utilizes, if condo 
	2. Otherwise, all property outside borders should be specified on summary page 
3. Definitions - list of what/who are covered by the policy. +terms
4. Conditions - do or not to do something
	1. Statutory conditions - universal to all policies 
	2. Policy specific conditions 
5. Exclusions:
	1. Property:
		1. Evidence of debt or title 
		2. Securities 
		3. Automobiles 
		4. Watercrafts 
		5. Money 
		6. Other motor vehicle s
		7. Books of account 
		8. Vacant property (> 30 days)
	2. Peril 
		1. Earthquake
		2. Floods 
		3. Smoke due to agricultural or industrial operations 
		4. Wear and tear or deterioration 
		5. Rust and corrosion 
		6. War 
		7. Nukes 
		8. Increased cost of construction 
		9. Sewer backup 
*Some of it is excluded to get more money from separate top-up coverage. Location is a key in pricing premiums for natural disasters  

6. Deductibles - added with almost no exceptions 
7. Claim payments - based on Cash value or Replacement Cost Basis 
	1. Valued basis - antique or precious items, requires third party valuation 
8. Standard Mortgage Clause - include guarantees to mortgagee
	1. Payment when insured breaches a policy condition. I.e if material misrepresentation occurs - lender still entitled to payment 
	2. Insurer will not reduce nor terminate coverage without notice to lender. Insurers MUST request and receive a consent

### Secondary residence form - secondary property included into the main policy as "location 2"
1. **Coverage A**: Dwelling building 
2. Fair rental value
3. Coverage extensions - available, however don't increase limit of Coverage A.
	1. May apply up to 10% to insure:
		1. Seasonal storage or removed items for time of repairs 
		2. Detached private structures 
		3. the primary building is worth $100,000, this would make $10,000 available for outbuildings. The two outbuildings consist of a garage worth $8,000 and a shed worth $4,000. Their combined value is over the $10,000 limit. If the garage were to burn down, Gaetan would not receive the full $8,000; instead, the payment would be based on what the value of the garage was to the total value of the outbuildings. The combined value is $12,000, and the garage, at $8,000, is 66.66% of that total. This means Gaetan would receive 66.66% of the limit available of $10,000 ($6,666) as settlement for the lost garage, less the deductible. If the shed were to burn down, the same process would be followed: the shed at $4,000 is 33.33% of $12,000, so the payment for this loss would be 33.33% of $10,000 ($3,333).
