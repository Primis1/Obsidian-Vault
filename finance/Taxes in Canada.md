### Special values:

### Concepts:

##### Overtake - gov takes too much at the begging at then calculates how much of "too much" it gives back 
- For employee deduction [T1213](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html) - form should be requested each year and be approved by CRA 

##### CRA audits - after deducting taxes by any claim(medical, donation etc expenses), CRA can request bill or confirmation of these expenses.  
- Allowed to keep scanned copies 
- CRA never sends e-transfers 

##### Tax return can be revised for last 10 years
- if something went wrong, you kept all docs and so on, request a tax revision 

##### College/University - for education tuition, [T2202](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2202.html)
- Tax credit from cost of education, can reduce tax amount up to 0$, ==also can be carried to next years== 
- Form should be provided by University 

##### GST Credit - for individual who haven't received a minimum of second bracket, small may receive tax payback 
- Can be claimed if unemployed but older than 19

##### Arbitrarily - when you don't fill taxes, CRA fills out instead of you
- Letters may be produced automatically, so don't bother if you fixed the issue

##### Penalties - in case of miss filing any tax sheet, therefore receiving penalties, fill RC4288 form, where you have to explain why mistake was done
- It takes months for penalties to be canceled 
