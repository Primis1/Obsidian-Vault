#### Concepts:
- margin of safety - measure for indicating that market price is significantly below their #instinct-value  
	- #breakeven-level - value of "breaking-out" of stock without loss 
#### Formulas:

###### #WACC - weighted cost of capital, represents the companies cost of borrowing money (`debt / equity`)
- By company - for company to measure a profitability of funding a new project
- By investor - to see their asset effectiveness. How much money they can generate for single dollar of assets (`Net Income / WACC`)

##### #DFC  discounted cash flow, shows the current price of the share $$\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{FCF}_t}{(1 + \text{WACC})^t} + \frac{\text{Terminal Value}}{(1 + \text{WACC})^n}$$
- 
	- `FCF` - free cash flow 
	- `WACC` - Weighted cost of capital 
	- n - number of years
	- t - years
	- Terminal value$$
 \frac{\text{FCF}_{n} \times (1 + g)}{\text{WACC} - g}$$
-  #instinct-value - $E*[2g+8.5]*4.4/y$
	1. E - #EPS
	2. g - annual growth
	3. Y - current #interest-rate 



##### margin of safety - current price - #instinct-value 


##### #NPV  Net Present Value; determines the income from investments with discount rate $$-C_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{\text{C}_y}{(1 + d)}$$
- `-C` - cost of initial investment 
- `Cy` - net cash flow for year `y` 
- `d` - discount rate (value add each circle); we can take #WACC as a discount rate 
$$-C_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{\text{C}_y}{(1 + d)} -> \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{\text{C}_y}{(1 + d)(1 + d)} $$
