### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Recurring revenue - occurs when customer buys additional product/service from company
1. Maintenance, subscriptions, licences, operating services 

- Recurring revenue can protect against cyclisity;
	- Example: in elevator business, which depends on market supply/over-supply dynamics, ==company can harvest recurring revenue in downturn, from locked-in customer base during expansion== === smoothing earnings and making cash-flows more sustainable and predictable 
	- Such services can create a mini-monopoly for captured customer base. Risk of failure creates switching costs that create a pricing power  

- Such business model requires high upfront costs, and if company struggles to capture new customers it can create a pricing/marketing war

- Customer & Suppliers usually recognize a monopoly and future and repeating expenses which leads to bargaining power(decrease in upfront costs). Such sophistication and therefore bargaining power will compress margins, **profitability-sustainability of recurring revenues should be weighted against those costs**     

- Such monopolies create a huge barriers to entry **and to exit**; raises a risk of retaliation and "sticky" competition 

#### Models of recurring revenue:
1. Service - maintenance after purchase, easily replicated by third party, **therefore contract based** 
	1. The significance of failure, the prone to hold deals and buy parts with original supplier 
	2. ==High accent on product longevity, significance of failure and place in cost structure==  
	3. Catch - long lasting, durable products ***don't break so often***, therefore recurring revenue doesn't come in couple month
	4. The bigger percentage(annual revenue / initial product cost) and time span the better 

2. Subscription - less favorable, no upfront cost and much looser switching barriers, which causes swifter change to cheaper variation. Depends on renewal of subscription. 
3. License - similar to subscription, however provides upfront expense which raises entry and switching costs barrier
	1. Also create a working capital advantage, because customer basically funds the business
