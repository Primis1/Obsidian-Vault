#### Components of CCC:
1. Days **Inventory** Outstanding - number of days company holds to its inventory, before it's **sold**. High ratio indicates slow-selling inventory, potential obsoleteness 

2. Days **Sales** Outstanding - also called debtor velocity, quantifies amount of days required to collect credits from customers who purchased a product. High ratio red-flags a credibility of firm's customer base or indicates potential ***bad debt**

3. Days **Payable** Outstanding - days required to pay its suppliers. High ratio indicates that firm takes **a fcn advantage from its suppliers, has a bargaining power and uses them to enhance its ROE**

#### Negative CCC ratio - superiority of the business over its suppliers, which helps to strengthen margins, reduces uncertainty and strategic risks
