### Terms Recognition:
1. Fragmentation - indicates competitive environment, through lack of ***sustainable*** benefits from scale

## Fragmented Industries 

#### Reasons for industry fragmentation:
1. Low, Overall, entry barriers
2. Absence of economies of scale or **benefit from size of production(small and large scale manufacturers or service providers have the same costs**
3. High Inventory costs & Erratic Sales - small firms often more adjustable to volume/demand shifts than larger one 
4. No size advantage with Buyers/Suppliers 
5. High demand for specialization / Diverse market needs
6. High Exit barriers 

#### Persistence of just one point can keep industry fragmented, however with technological improvements and creation of Scale-Economies - industry consolidates 
- Thus fixing existing problem/s can trigger consolidation 
- One of the strategies to make different in-house labels, which can benefit from ES 
- ##### Couple methods to cope with fragmentation:
	- "Standard Procedure" facilities, when company targets optimization by standardizing new plants or creating a blueprint-template
	- Increase "value" across customer's value chain(commodity can provide vertical integration or customer service)  
	- Specialize in product or customer segment - focus strategy 
		- Those segment can be a cap for market share, whoever its a trade-off between volume and margins 
	- No Frills - low skilled employees, low overhead, tight cost control(Tim funcken Hortons) 


#### Pitfalls on capturing share
- Foolish dominance - good on a words but not prudent in practice actions. "We will invest into most technological facilities... which have negative NPV."
- Assumption that competitor have the same objective and will according to the plan 
- **Overreaction to new product** - buyers can slowly, rather than promptly, try out new product and with persistence of switching costs it may take years, thus **smear the cashflow over greater time period**

#### Analyzing such industries
1. Identify sources of competitive forces within industry, structure of industry and significant competitors  
	1. Causes of fragmentation; Analyse business economics 
2. Can any of those forces be overcome by innovation? Who among firms is better positioned for rn and the future 
3. Is it economically feasible to consolidate the industry 
4. Who will cope with such fragmented structure 

## Emerging Industries 

#### Long story - short: 
- New industries which substitute old one, with already blew up size, can face counter-force from:
	- Old-industry and its workers 
	- Regulators who can't ignore the new industry anymore 
	- Sticky consumers who may witnessed lack of credibility or else
	- Lack of standardization or high disparity in quality +decreasing costs(slow down the purchases which slows down investments
	- #### Retaliation from disrupted industry, aka price war or competition in R&D
#### Transition to new industry by customers:
- Industry credibility 
- Obviousness of benefits/superiority 
- Significance in competitive race for the buyers in absolute and particularly against substitute
	- ##### Apple switched its processors from Intel's old architecture to ARM
- **Will the current(rudimentary) version of product suitable for every customer segment or some require only *state-of-the-art version to obtain substantial benefit***
- What's is a share of buyers for which product is at **Point of Failure**? They will be much slower to adopt new product

#### Acknowledgement - analyses for product adoption for new industry is the same as analysis of competitive advantage for disrupted industry
- Just from standpoint of adversary 
- Switching costs, Value/Price for buyers & Brand power of old industry are key points in assessment 

#### Importance of flexibility - in EI distribution of outcomes and possible evolutions is too great, therefore, in regards to mobility barriers, curtain level of flexibility of likelihood of good performance under many scenarios is a defensive approach
