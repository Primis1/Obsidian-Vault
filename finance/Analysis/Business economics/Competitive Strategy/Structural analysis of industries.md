### Terms Recognition:
1. Industry - group of firms which produce substitute products

### Concepts:
### Entry - new entrance to the industry may bid down prices through excess capacity and  reducing the profitability through reaction of existing players 
- New entry isn't necessary. **Diversification through acquisition also counts as new entry, because firm with larger ounces of capital can intensify the rivalry**

##### Sources for entry barriers:
 1. Economies of scale - cost of production decreases with each new unit
	 1. Thus, new entrance require large capital to obtain go-to production levels or **bear the weak pricing**
	 2. **Joint costs - diversified firms produce product A, which then may be used for fulfillment of service B**. Airlines in both passenger and cargo business, can take "light" passenger and also a cargo into plane's haul
	 3. **Sharing of fixed costs** and **intangible assets** across subsidiaries
	 4. Vertically integrated economies. **New entrances must adapt itself to standards set by leaders** 
	
2. Product differentiation - marketing expenses harness customer's loyalty, NE must suffer start-up fees and other expenses to overcome that loyalty 
3. Capital requirement - unrecoverable costs like R&D, marketing or depreciated assets are threats 
4. Switching costs - new entrances should offer substantially higher value to offset SC 
5. Access to distribution channels
6. Government policies - tight regulation with high upfront expenses and intense rivalry are *killing* mix
##### Large scale and experience may provide protection *within one business cycle*. Large leviathan are less likely adapt to changed technology, unlike new white-paper firms, who can start from up-to-date facilities without burden of old assets
- However it's the case only in the end of product or whole market cycle 

#### Rivalry among existing companies - industry, especially slow growth one, retaliation on one side will have interconnected effect on all other firms
- Price cuts are quickly matched by competitors for instance

#### Slow industry growth - because there aren't room for all companies, they intensively fight for market share 


#### High exit barriers - counter intuitively, but high EB are *bad* for existing firms, because entrances choose to find until the end - thus scrutinize the profitability 
- Fixed costs or specialized assets(with low liquidation value)
- Interrelationship with other business units - common production, location, intangibles, etc 
- Emotional barriers of management 
- Government denial or discouragement

### Substitute from another product - its not necessary coming from "neighborhood". Substitute is anything that executes the same function 
- Product may also benefit the industry and be added to service-package(human security + security camera)

#### Buyers - with concentration, businesses of individual buyers becoming more important for business, increasing revenue beta
- High volume buyers may set the prices and firm become a price taker 

#### Supplier group is powerful if:
1. Suppliers are concentrated but buyers are fragmented
2. The industry **isn't** an important customer to suppliers 
3. Product **is** an important input for buyers 
4. They build up a switching costs
