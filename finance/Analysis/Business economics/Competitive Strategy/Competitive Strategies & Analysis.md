### Terms Recognition:
- Generic Strategies:
	- Overall cost leadership 
	- Differentiation 
	- Focus

- I should think about competitive decision based on industry/product landscape, for instance, if my company wants to penetrate market X, where we have **company A** which focuses on **market share and low costs**(however it is an integrated business which makes changes to it **slow or impossible**), thus competing in cost rivalry will destroy larger competitor
	- Hit where it will hurt the most considering current strategy, position, development and market share 

- What are events which will asymmetrically effect profitability and/or revenue growth 

$$\text{Sustainable Growth = (Asset turnover) }* \text{After tax return on sales}* \text{D/E}* \text{Fraction of retianed earnings} $$
### Concepts:

#### Any competitive strategy focuses on defending business from 5 competitive threats, what, in fact, will help in sustaining revenue growth and margins and/or remain superior in the industry

#### 5 competitive forces:

- *Rivalry among existing firms may also include threat of replication *

### Cost leadership - be more efficient/productive than peers 
1. Aggressive investment into efficient-scale products and facilities 
2. Pursuit of cost reductions 
3. Cost and overhead control 
4. Avoidance of marginal customer account 
5. Cost minimization in R&D and S&A areas 
	- ##### Through removal of redundancy or improved efficiency

- ##### It should lead to lower costs relative to closest competitors 

- ##### Cost efficiency often requires big market share or ==sources== of cost reductions, such us achieving economies of ==scope==/==scale== (benefits of shared fixed costs and volumes) and target major customer groups(e.x for meat major customers are fast-food companies)
	- It may also require bigger product portfolio or advances in manufacturing/developing(**more efficiently than other**) 
	- Capturing market share may require **high upfront and sunk costs, aggressive pricing**

#### Risks include: 
1. Technological change which opens gap for competitors to steal market share(**from Ford to GM**)
2. Increased capacity of industry and lowering of entry costs
3. **Narrowing of price advantage, which makes high-quality/premium products more attractive**
4. **No-brainer**, too much focus on cost advantage may can backfire in case of changing consumer preferences  

### Differentiation - be unique/provide unique product within industry 
1. Design of brand image 
2. Technology(something that's not easy to replicate or be ahead of the game for several years) 
3. Provide unique features/customer service 
4. Dealer network 

##### Firm should *not* ignore costs, just brand name *should* be the priority 

6. Achieving **differentiation** leads to lower market share and volumes
	1. Thus, puts firm into dangerous position in case of changing consumer preferences 

#### Risks include: 
1. Premium for product can become too big for brand image to offset 
2. Buyers' need for firm's **unique** product falls 
3. 

### Focus - do niche stuff really-really good; or serve need of targeted consumer base really-really well
1. I.e customer prefer firms services for it superiority, for that particular **demography, set of companies or for *that* segment in value chain**
2. Firm has differentiated itself from peers in eyes of **target** and/or has **cost advantage prepared for them**

#### Risks include: 
1. Differentiation for target and overall market is too narrow 
	1. Or cost advantage in compare to broad market is too high
2. Competitors find **sub-market** within target and nullify the narrow specialty  


### Requirement:

### Stuck in the middle problem 
- Firm can't fully implement any competitive strategy - positioning itself in wort spot, with no market share, price premium or loyal customer base 

### Defensive capabilities:
- Vulnerability - to what macroeconomic or industry events would the competitor be most vulnerable, or to **what are events which will asymmetrically**
