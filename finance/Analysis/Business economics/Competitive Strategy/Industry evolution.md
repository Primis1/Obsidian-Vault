### Terms Recognition:
1. Force of nature - entry/mobility barriers, consolidation, preferences, threats of substitute **constantly change over time** 
2. Questions should be asked to 5 competitive powers which influence every industry

### Concepts:

#### Product Life Cycle - defined by product sales
![[Pasted image 20250629214253.png]]
1. Introductory phase indicates hurdle in overcoming obstacles such as customer's inertia and stimulating trials(to attract new customers)
2. Growth occurs after customers rush into industry after it became trustworthy 
3. After majority of herd started to use the product, industry experience slower growth(little people left who doesn't use the product)
4. Change in preferences indicates decline in sales(substitute product appears on the market)

##### Product cycles are unclear. Stages differ between products and industries +some products may go straight into decline, skipping maturity

#### Industry growth rate - the most important factor. It identifies both rivalry and pace of expansion required to maintain market share. Reasons to change:
1. Demographics - change in household structure(education, age, income, geography) and birth rate of population 
	1. Income elasticity - change in product preferences as income raises

2. Trend in needs - generational trends like demand for more leisure, hospitality, travel or care for nature - obviously rises demands for "matched" products 
	1. Government regulations are also in tact - subsidiaries for solar panels or legalizing of gambling

3. Growth rate of substitute product - substitute captures the same customer or satisfies similar customer needs -> decline in growth rate/market share

4. Position of complementary products - increase in electric charging station will complement the demand and convenience for EVs 

5. Customer penetration - with maturity, business sells its products to repeated customers. The mechanism for growth differs - to increase revenue with existing customers business can **a) increase consumption per capita or b) stimulate replacement**
	1. That naturally makes room for deeply integrated maintenance firms 
	2. It also indicates oversupply/capacity, potentially making some product **exit the market**

6. Product innovation/change to serve new needs

#### Change in segment served - Netflix served gig-auditory who like to receive new movies by mail, but through early adoption of internet captured mass market  

#### Learning by buyers - products tend to become like commodities, when buyer become more sophisticated. It leads to standardization and quality preferences or value/price trade-off
- Business may provide new features or capture new inexperienced customers 

#### Reduction of uncertainty - establishing of products and customer base 
- May attract new entrances 

#### Diffusion of R&D/Operating knowledge - spreads across industry through the shortage of skilled labor  
- Competitors/Substitute can raise on accumulated knowledge without burden of old assets. With help of economies of scale(which can also help keep the knowledge at home, through amounts of information) or low entry barriers new entrances are unavoidable

##### *On the market, there is a place for innovator, imitator and fool*

#### Expansion(Contraction) - increase in total scale(through margin and volume) 
- Leads to increased variability of strategies
- With significant size, industry may attract larger players from similar industries, which observed the growth & worthiness of entrance and have enough capabilities to compete with existing original firms(recreation vehicles -> small business started from scratch -> temptation for established firms)

#### Change in input costs - changing macroeconomic condition and business's correlation with it. Mainly influencing margins and/or volumes(in regards to successful cost passing)
- Wages/Cost of labor 
- Material costs(CapEx)
- Cost of capital 
- Communication costs(marketing)
- Logistic barriers and costs(war which hostiles Suez's)

#### Product innovation - can widen the market and thus lengthen the growth curve start a new growth phase through new customer segments and satisfying new functions 
- On the other hand, high marketing costs and possible obsoleteness can create a mobility barrier(innovation in AI chips made switching from conventional too pricely)    

#### Government policies - change in regulations, credits, subsidiaries, etc -> influences the course of industry

#### Entry and Exit - high growth often lures companies to enter the industry, however high costs of entry barriers may slow down the migration(thus for existing firms it's good to keep those barriers high)
