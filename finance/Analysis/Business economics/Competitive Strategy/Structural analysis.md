### Terms Recognition:
1. CS - customer segment
2. Success of the business depends on match of its strength/weaknesses with current-forward opportunities presented by the environment
	1. Those weakness may be industry specific and group specific(competitive forces) and strategy specific(advantages of business model)
	- ##### in general, investments into "strength" are all about improvements of competitive position(better customer capture or cheaper product -> higher and more durable revenue); thus actions which will raise mobility costs for outsiders are beneficial 
		- In each industry/group those *barriers* are different; in soft drinks -> distribution channels & brand

### Concepts:

#### Dimensions within industry

#### Strategic groups/options:
1. Specialization - the degree to which it focuses its efforts at **width of product line, target CS, or geography**
2. Brand identification - degree to which it avoids price wars and invests into: **advertising, sales force or special *quality/feature***
3. Distribution channels - owning/renting its assets
4. Tech leadership - degree to which it seeks innovation and tech superiority, instead of imitating           (**remark: tech advancement != product quality**)
5. Vertical integration - degree to which it **adds value to customer** by backward/forward integration with recipient 
6. Cost advantage - both for customer and firm 
7. Leverage 

##### Industry can be divided into strategic group which prioritize different techniques(listed above) and customer niches
- Industry often has two to three most important strategic dimensions and consolidates(depending on fragmentation) itself into several SG's where firms are pretty much alike

##### Mobility barrier - firms are protected from new entrance into segment, just as much as *==shifting== from one segment into another* 
- **Narrow line, unbranded assembler** **will face similar** difficulties(depending on overlap of groups) in entering **broad-line, nationally integrated segment**  
- However switching difference can be narrowed through technological disruption, progress in expertise, industry maturing or simple evolution 
- ##### Rivalry between groups depends on interconnection of customer base(when firms in different segments fighting for same customer) 

- ##### Warfare within industry(thus between groups) will escalate if firms with different approaches, of similar size, fight for the same customer or market and vice versa

	- In this example, companies in right corner are in much better position than in left one, through the absence of rivalry
#### Smaller vs Bigger - size matters, but not always. In segment where *some* specialization posses higher significance than economies of scale with weak shifting barriers - firm's profitability will depend on superiority of execution
