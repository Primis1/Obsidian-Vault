### Terms Recognition:
1. Moat rating - we assess each of the competitive powers(and its subcategories) and assign moat ratings based on its power's presence and sustainability
	1. Be divide and conquer approach we may see strong and weak aspects of the business and apply **general moat rating**

### Concepts:

#### Moat can be assigned to business in case of positive and sustainable economic profit
- Business may have several forms of competitive advantage, which will differentiate it from competition(**Intangibles, **) 

- #### Intangibles should translate into pricing power:
	1. Brands:
	- **What is the pricing power that brand conveys? Is there a premium that company can charge?(relative to competitors)** - recognition doesn't guarantee a **any** pricing power. Airlines companies are highly recognizable, however consumers don't put any weight on the brands   
	
	- **Is premium offset by higher COGS** - some companies may charge higher pricing just because their product is more expensive(*maybe* higher quality). To make it a moat company's pricing power should **at least** offset the production costs

	- **Company's margin in compare to competitors/peers that do/don't have a brand?** - helps to analyze any pricing power of the brand 

	- **Sustainability of the brand in minds of consumers** - companies with slower customer turnover more likely to develop a sustainable brand. After tasting coke or pepsi, consumer will decide for a long time what he will drink.
		- On contrary, parents who choose infant formula, have preferences in short time period after child is born 
		- Companies which continuously pump money into R&D(innovation) and marketing campaigns **are more likely to sustain pricing power** 

	 2.  Regulations: 
	 - **Does regulation provide meaningful pricing power or just burden?** - Airport de Paris may have a geographic monopoly to the most popular destination itw. However government regulation scrutinize the pricing power to the extend that it can't generate an economic profit
	
	 - **Threat of substitute** - consider whether customers may prefer analog from *somewhere else* 

	3.  Cost Advantage:
	- **Benefit from economies of scale? What evidence we have to constitute that company benefits from lower per/unit costs, than competitor with lesser volumes?** - If production costs are actually lower, company should have higher top-line than competitor with the same or lesser volumes(i.e that company not falsificates its "cheaper production thesis" by lowering prices and boosting volumes) 
	
	- **Does company benefits from economies of scope(interconnection of production)** - batteries for sale may be used for for EV as well. R&D knowledge may be used through variety of products
	- **Logistic cost advantage?** - local production or lesser transportation costs. Lesser volume required
	- **Bargaining power with suppliers** - *Costco*
	- **Does company becomes more efficient in its core OpEx & CapEx areas?** - railroads became double more efficient in compare to last century - thanks to energy, locomotive and workforce improvements


	4. Switching Costs:
	- **What are renewal rates?** - higher switching costs manifest themselves in high-renewal businesses
	- **How much money, time and effort is required to switch?** - risks with switching, high costs of switching may stop the process
		- **Does alternative product is superior enough to switch from the first place?(besides pricing costs)**
	- Black Rock and Apple - ITunes/Storage and Mutual fund fees 
	- **Does company provides variety of products?** - if yes, consumer may switch within the company's portfolio
	- **What part of OP cost structure is the product or service?** - does the product is a major part of operating expenses(if yes, then cheaper & better alternatives will likely be chosen)

	5. Network Effect:
	- **Explain how value of good or service increases with scale of customers/suppliers. Prove that value increases faster than the rate of customers/supplier addition(`sales per unit&user / sales per branch`) with regards to history**
		- Example: e-com website generates 1m in revenue for 1,000 users (`revenue/sales per user = 1000$`), next year revenue increased by 50%, number of users by 40%, thus RPU increased by 7%
		- Consistency of such growth indicates modest-moderate network effect. Can be achieved by cost reduction thanks to new users or increased value(thus spendings) per user
	- **How does company monetize its network with growing users?** - Ability to monetize network through advertising, subscriptions or charges - **are required for cash generation and re-investing into network**
		- Without sufficient network monetization 
	- **Does the company have a bargaining power before customers and suppliers?** - if company can't charge higher prices with enhancing value, network effect won't be visible on fin-statements 

	6.  Efficient scale:
	- **Define limits of market. Is the addressable market finite or has blur boundaries?** - in pipeline business, oil producers need to transport 250 bbl a day, capacity of pipelines is 275. What market share can you capture with perfect supply/demand equilibrium? 
	- **What are sink costs of entering the market? How much market share new competitor have to capture in order to recoup the costs?**
