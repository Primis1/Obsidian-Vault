### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Types: 
1. Backwards - towards input-services, such as controlling supply of raw material
	1. Requires big capital expenditures
	2. Exposes firm to commodity-volatility and market supply-demand issues 
	3. By controlling material supplier, firm can put subsidiary into conflict of interest - if market demand for goods is strong it may supply RM for cheaper price - benefiting core business but harming the supplier 
	4. Exposes to huge capital loss/expense through tech disruption and/or cost optimization(when subsidiary should remain its costs the same as competitor's to simply make sense for core business)
2. Forward - closer to end of supply chain, aka consumer. It can be retail, software or distribution network 
	1. Require high quality *human capital*. Sale force, strongly competitive stores and marketing
	2. Other investments into intangible assets, R&D(of hardware company goes towards software for instance)

3. Balanced - controlling entire supply chain
	1. Should maintain superior position on all fronts
	2. Essentially becomes an industry itself, not possible without economies of scale unless risk to **stuck in the middle**
#### Generally saying - firm should have competitive advantage in area where it wants to integrate and/or integration will have *large* benefit/complementary
- cost optimization 
- value-enchantment 
- and overall *uncertainty* reduction) to core business 

#### Market power - properly executed vertical integration enhances company's position against all competitive forces and can create a competitive advantage & barriers to entry(depending on the industry)

- Although, firm gets all the benefits of economies of scale, in case of industries where those economies aren't important or mobility barriers are a threat 

#### Integration through mergers - the trait for success in integration is to make it with ***==strong==*** business. Which is competitive and doesn't exist as a simple appendix to core operations. Therefore mergers of two good businesses on different sides of supply chain *will* lead to, ==in most cases==,  superior position 

Example:

*Promise*:
- **CVS Health & Aetna (2018):** The merger of CVS Health and Aetna represents a balanced integration, combining retail pharmacies, insurance services, and direct patient care.29 This integration aimed to transform the consumer health experience, providing more personalized and accessible healthcare by leveraging CVS's nationwide retail locations for walk-in clinics, chronic disease management, and medication adherence programs.29 The merger was expected to yield significant synergies, enhance competitive positioning, and accelerate growth by simplifying the healthcare system and improving care coordination and financial sustainability.29 Vertical integration in healthcare seeks to address rising costs and fragmented care by creating unified systems, but it faces significant integration and regulatory hurdles.

 Result:
- The 2018 merger of CVS Health and Aetna created a vertically integrated healthcare model combining retail pharmacies, insurance services, and direct patient care.29 While the merger aimed to transform the consumer health experience and improve care coordination, it faced significant post-merger implementation challenges. The American Medical Association (AMA) argued that the merger was unlikely to realize efficiencies that would benefit patients and would reduce competition in certain pharmaceutical benefit markets, potentially leading to higher premiums and lower-quality insurance products.23 Financially, CVS reported a disappointing forecast for 2019 earnings, with the transformative acquisition taking longer than expected to bear fruit.16 The company incurred substantial integration costs ($550 million) and incremental investments ($350 million), coupled with a high debt load resulting from the acquisition.16 This case highlights that large-scale vertical integration in highly regulated and complex industries like healthcare faces intense scrutiny and significant operational and financial hurdles, with expected benefits often taking longer than anticipated to materialize.

#### Integration is not a panacea - if firm's core business is weak, robust and tough to digest integrations put it into high risk and huge capital outflows which could be more useful in marketing, value enhancing or R&D 

#### Cross-Cutting Reasons for Failure

- **Poorly Conceived Strategy or Lack of Strategic Clarity:** Integrations often falter when the perceived purpose is unrealistic or when there is insufficient long-term alignment of mission, vision, and objectives
    - I.e when management doesn't explain precise objective or long term strategic benefit from integration 

- **Overpaying:** Companies sometimes overpay for acquisitions, driven by a desire to block competitive bids or gain market share rapidly
	- Risk is higher with price. H. Marks 
    
- **Incompatibility:** When management thinks that after success in one stage of supply chain they can easily succeed in other. Fun part they are wrong 
    
- **Lack of Due Diligence:** Insufficient time spent on the due diligence process, or the involvement of the wrong personnel, can lead to critical issues being overlooked.
    
- **Executive Leadership Turnover:** A significant number of top-management executives often depart during the first year after an acquisition, a rate nearly three times higher than normal.
    
- **Increased Complexity and Reduced Flexibility:** Vertical integration inherently increases the complexity of a company's operations, demanding more resources to manage effectively.  
	- This expansion can also reduce a company's flexibility to respond to market changes or pursue new opportunities, ***as seen with Kodak's inability to adapt to the digital revolution due to its heavy investment in film***

#### Partnerships, joint venture or special contracts can replace VI and remove risks related to expansion
