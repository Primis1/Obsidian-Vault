### Terms Recognition:
1. Any action, no matter: acquisition, carve-out, merger; may create value by increasing **short or long** term cash-flow; or **destroy it**  
2. Portfolio - various business units 
3. Shareholder value - may be destroyed if shareholders are not compensated for beared risks 

### Concepts:

#### Proactive approach - management has a greater insights into industries where business operates, thus may implement proactive actions through divestitures
- Change in consumers behavior, technological disruption or other opportunities, may provide a good reason for proactive sell-off for subsidiary 
- Management, however, not frequently **does** those proactive actions in fear of lowering **EPS**, thus may execute divestiture under pressure(when it's too late and opportunity will only **destroy** value) 

#### Due to, in general, poor execution or no-value acquisitions, M&A negatively impacts stock return
- Company rarely manages to obtain value for shareholder because: **a) high premiums b) generally bad deal**

#### Characteristics of successful acquisition:
- Strong operating performance of acquirer 
- Low transaction costs
- Single bidder privilege 

- ##### Inconsequential factors:
	- Size relative to buyer 
	- Whether transaction increase/decrease EPS 
	- P/E relative to acquirer 
	- Industry relatedness to acquirer 

#### Deals are not good or bad, business should have clearly-articulated *goal* tied with acquisition 
- Vague on the other hand, those without clear objective, tend to be a failure and disasters 
	- *We want to expand internationally or fill in portfolio gaps or build third leg for portfolio*

#### Types of M&A which tend to create value:
- Improve performance of target 
- Consolidate to remove excess capacity from the industry -  
- Create market access for the target's products - firms with innovative products have no access scale markets 
- Acquire skills, technologies, facilities more quickly - add new product lines 
- Pick winner early(VC play) - acquire business before competition in early stage of life-cycle 

- #### it may still destroy value if you overpay

#### Cost optimization - after consolidation, cost structure may be reduced by each segment(from manufacturing to SG&A)

#### Revenue improvement - adding new products/services which wouldn't be possible standalone
- Increase the speed of product roll-out 
- Extend product's life-cycle 

#### Competitor acquisition in diluted industry - will *not* create a bargaining power
