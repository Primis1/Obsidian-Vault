### Terms Recognition:
1. Alternative P/E: $$P/E = \frac{1-\frac{g}{ROE}}{k-g}$$K - cost of equity 


### Concepts:

#### Problem with multiples is that it may be useful only in case of right peer-group comparison, furthermore any multiple does not account future prospects of firm(probably) 
- Thus, should not be relied blindly. If company trades with EV/EBITA 13(higher end of industry average) it means **shit**, because it may not account future expected earnings power(well, yea it's kinda P/E with expectations)
- Peer group should be selected withing similar value drivers(similar ROIC, Growth, NOPLAT, WACC)

#### Value/EBITA - focuses on valuation version of "value"(projected NOPLAT divided by growth, ROIC and WACC)
- Similar to P/E ratio

#### High current multiple may represent high expectations or weakness relative to historical averages 
- Thus historical changes in multiples should be assessed. For both change in expectations and worsens of fundamentals 

#### When comparing IT companies, separate operating amortization with acquisition amortization into EBITA 
- In all other, use adjusted EBITA ratio

#### Companies fall into three categories according to multiples:
- Low growth, low margin -> low EV/EBITA
- Low growth, high margins -> medium EV/EBITA
- High growth, High Margins -> high EV/EBITA 
- ##### Ratios reflect projected, roughly current, performance of companies within peer group
##### After classifying, dig into reasons: why did company A, superior(has a higher multiple) to company B
- *They have better product? netter access to customers, recurring revenue or economy of scale*

### PEG ratio(Price-to-Earning/Growth)
$$\frac{\text{Enterprise Value Multiple}}{100*\text{Expected EBITA Growth Rate}}$$
- We should assess the company's perspective growth drivers and estimate **our own PEG or EV/EBITA ratio** then compare it to peers(Difference in multiples is priced in, by company's fundamentals and expected change in those fundamentals) 
	- Thus we should assess justification of such valuation
	- Example: company started to trade below its average multiples(EV, PEG), without change in projections or through seasonal/one-time troubles
	- However, to spot it, we have to implement valuation process, therefore multiples yet again are just backing up our core valuation thesis
