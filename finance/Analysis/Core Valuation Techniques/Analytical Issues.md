### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:

#### Intersectional Influence - even a small improvements/worsens in margins or growth will drag(up or down) all other
- More cash on hands -> better interest coverage ratio -> lesser cost of debt -> higher NOPLAT/FCF stream, besides overall bigger output in NOPLAT/FCF itself 
- Snowball effect requires complete recalculation 


#### Scenario analysis - prepare several estimations of improvements or deterioration, keep track on company's reports
#### Operating Leases:
- When company leases, it **does not record it as liability or asset**, instead it records rental charge(expense)
- Include value of lease as an operating asset, with corresponding debt recorded as line item 
	- *Otherwise company will look "capital light",  in compare to those which purchase assets*
$$\text{Asset Value = } \frac{\text{Rental Expense}}{k_d + \frac{1}{Asset-Life}}$$
- k_d - cost of debt



#### When estimating buy/hold/sell thesis for company we should regard level of uncertainty in DCF calculation. If uncertainty is high, we should demand higher margin of safety(bigger discount in regards of `stock price/fair value`) 
- Systematic risk + Company specific risk = Uncertainty Rating
- SR - Cost of equity, `Revenue beta to economy `, operating leverage, financial leverage
- CSR:
	- regulatory changes
	- large contract/licence/patent expirations
	- High customer concentrations 
	- Changing client preference(in both industry and product line)
	- Unpredictable management 
	- Questionable capital allocation
	- Risk of disruption

### Explicit forecast period
- While time horizon does not change the ending value of company, extending explicit forecast period leads to omission of **ROIC --> WACC**, therefore such forecast are most likely *overoptimistic*
- However each of those assumption should be backed-up by economic trends(KO and PP won't likely loose their ROIC, because of strength of their brand names)
- #### Multi stage DCF(Morning-star approach): 
	- Stage 1
	- Stage 2 
	- Stage 3 
	- Depending on economic moat, economic profit may erode faster or slower. 

#### Earnings surprise affect the share price only and only when it's grounded by improvements/worsens in future values of cash flows

#### Liquidity pressure(in case of inclusion/exclusion from major indexes) does not affect share in any term longer than 1-Q
- However it may improve stock efficiency through increase in analyst coverage
