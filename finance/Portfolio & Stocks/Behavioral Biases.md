### Terms Recognition:
1. Investors should protect themselves from any kind of not-number decisions, or sometimes, use them in their advantage(security arbitrage)

2. Theme -  and business in the industry and sectors **CAN HAVE THEME in itself, BY COMPARING, INVESTIGATING AND ANALYZING**, we may build our own **themes for future** and analyze the stock with that ***theme*** in mind

3. *Halo Effect* - **feeling about one aspect** of the entity influence the opinion **about the whole**(yep, women)
	1. Pharmaceutical business may have promising trial results, but garbage management, brand and everything else

### Concepts:

#### Protect yourself form System 1 thinking during fin decisions
- Lazy thinking(**gut feeling**) should be avoided, at any stage(from filtering to holding) 

##### Choice Architecture and Libertarian Paternalism 
- Build your decisions around a **investment theme** and **avoid noise**. Avoid large options of unrelated themes and ideas  

- **Avoid multitasking** - only 2% of globe can successfully multitask. Always think, be focused on what is in front of you, however avoid it during research   

#### Familiarity Bias - don't avoid companies with weird, not natural names, tickets or just because of it's location
- Stick to fundamentals, industry knowledge and macroeconomic factors which may influence the region. Only if it doesn't pass though factors - dump it 

#### Inside View Bias - consider that you always have more unknowns, than knowns
- Again, avoid decisions by gut. Instead step outside and research: **changing market/demand, competition and unknowns **
	- If we want to find something that took a big seasonal hit, and we look to do an arbitrage - **does it really seasonal? Does company lost its competitive advantage or is it technological or supply change?**
	- Maybe ask an expert(**conferences**)

#### Availability Bias - dig information where it's less comfortable to do
- Avoid subjective, **personal**, experience have a **large influence on decisions about the industry, sectors or company** 
- Seek for new sources of information(**need to look it up**) and don't make moves based on *fresh and vivid info*

#### Risk aversion - be rational about risk, use it in advantage and don't have stereotypes about it
- **More stable** and less "risky" sectors can **have worse risk/reward** ratio, because ppl can pay for security premium and therefore thinning margin of safety

- **You can diversify** in relation to overall portfolio or take a high-risk stock within low-risk theme

- **Compare to the peers**

- **Use scenarios: bullish/bearish**  

#### Dividend Bias - dividends should not influence stock picking(but shareholder yield DOES)


#### Over and Confidence Bias - trust no one, think by yourself, listen to experts ==but murder those who don't have accountability behind thesis== 
- Seek less biased sources of info. Acknowledge that most "analytics" no the interviews don't hold **those stocks**
- Watch for CEO who tells the stories instead of answering questions. Watch out for CEO who:
	- Has bad track record 
	- Uses inner thinking 
	- Understates strategic risk
	- During mergers, analyse acquisition, check how its risk profile and ROIC  

### After you pick the stock 

##### Inside lag
- Time **to react for upcoming event** events. **Apply news, recalculate value, trends, etc**
##### Outside lag
- **Time for changes to have impact on consumers**

#### It's probably priced in...

##### What you see is all there is - don't fall into self-confirmation trap
- After seeing good news, we **rarely respond/accept to something grossly** 

##### After we narrowed it to the short list, which share common theme 
- Different industries can have different research process, but always have something in common. *Every business is selling something in one way or another*

##### System 2 Due diligence 
- **SWOT
- **Porter's Five Forces**
- **4-W's** -
	- *Who uses* - doctors, technicians, average/elite consumers. **What is demand(mass or custom production, biases and who's an end user**
	- *Who chooses* - for commodities i**t's often administration or managers**, not working personal or consumers  
	- *Who pays* - does company, insurance or government
	- *Who profits* - does the product have **substantial value, if yes for what sides?**
- **Determine business ==value== drivers**
- **Contract** the thesis and reevaluate it with time   

#### Think critically towards ratios, what they reflect and what can influence their underlying drivers. ==Bad cash flow is the consequence of low consumption or gross margin, which is emerged from lack of sales==   

*The key to that kind of due diligence(without valuation) is making it tough. Investments should **not be** **easy***


Consumer discretionary firms are cyclical in earnings and in economic conditions, they don’t wait to perform bad when market performs well, stock price is only reflection of sentiments and macro/micro factors. Why does sector perform bad? Because there are no cash flows, why there aren’t? Lack of customers or their bargaining power. Why spent less? Because economy is struggling and consumer don’t have money… 
What to watch? How much excess consumer has and what can influence that 

Cash flow is just a number of customers
