### Terms Recognition:
1. Shareholder's yield - free money returned(amount of dividends, buybacks and debt reduction / market cap) back to steak holders (**Value Concept**)
	1. Firm growth yield - free money which are spend on expanding business beyond its current core (**Growth Concept**)
	2. Lack of revenue growth can be offset by enhancement in company operation and leveraging shareholder's yield, which can lead outperformance
2. Stock price is a market's assessment of company's future cash flows


### Concepts:

#### Business gets funding from Free Cash Flow
- Word "free" indicates funds which are left after funding all expenses required to generate revenue and don't become bankrupt(pay interest)  

#### Uses of FCF:

**(Shareholder's Yield**)
- Dividends 
- Net Buy-backs 
- *Net Deb reduction* - value of business does not change in regards of capital structure, **but ownership does** (by reducing debt we raise equity, and transfer value from debtors to investors)
	- Change in long+short term debt

### Business which can't create value by growth/expansion from its cash-flows, **has to return those money back to investors in form of Shareholders Yield** 
- Also, during assessment numbers should be netted to find real SY, because of share dilution/debt borrowing


(**Firm Growth/Expansion Yield)**
- ### Inorganic growth - M&As 
- ### Organic growth - reinvestment in company ***capital projects**(R&D or OP CapEx)

If ROIC or efficiency improvements **are real**, growth stocks, reinvest all their 'free cash' into expansion which

#### From growth to value
- Business which appears to be in late corporate cycle, struggles to find opportunities above its incremental cost of capital. Therefore decides to returns it's excess cash back to investors

***Non perfect growth/Dirty expansion to capture market share -> improvements in efficiency -> quality growth -> weakening of growth -> transition to value***

#### The Three Drivers of Equity Market Performance:
- P/E change - amount of market growth/decline driven by P/E expansion/subtraction 

- EPS growth
- Dividends 

Value = (1 + P/E Change) * (1 + EPS Growth) * (1 + Dividends)

- ##### To get outperformance we should have P/E expansion of our portfolio. I.e buy something that is a) undervalued by share price or b) future projected growth

- Value of financial economy(market) is driven by prospects and events in real economy

- P/E is driven(and therefore fluctuates) through inflation expectation 
- Inflation --> drives interest rates --> interest rates (capital) are drivers business growth/expansion(*in good case scenario*)
	- Long term interest rates are used as **discounter** of future cash-flows, and cash-flow are drivers of P/E expansion. 
		- **I.e compression of multiplicator or increase of denominator



#### P/E ratio is inversely correlated with interest rates
