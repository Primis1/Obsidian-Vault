### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:
- Corporate Venture Funds 
- Roll up - merging of multiple small companies within the industry into one company  
- Steer-up-growth - unlike linear, company sacrifices margins in short-term, and 

#### Alpha with hedge fund managers 
- Over last 15 years HF's generated alpha declined, from 50% of outperforming HF M to just 20% in 2025

- It has relation to interest rates - the cheaper the money, the better overall index performs, the more pressure is on HF  

- Psychological Pressure:
	- Underperformance creates **outflow** of cash from HF 
	- More pressure creates more **short-term decisions**
	- Such decisions create poor performance and **then**
	- **Outflow** of cash from HF
#### Interest Rates

- Since 2010th, alpha potential got weaker than its historical figures

- It relates with low interest rates, which boost **even poor business into competitive advantage**

- Passive investments are forced to invest into equity, due to **low bond yield**. Creating demand for risk assets 
- Lengthen **business cycle**(short-debt/credit **cycle described by Ray Dalio**)

#### Investment ==tenets==
- Goal **congruence** & **fiduciary** - trust people you work with. If management is shady - skip it. There are much more opportunities 

- **Invest in Fundamentals** - avoid behavioral mistakes and dig deep into analyzing fundamentals AND **business operations** 

- **Future valuation** - after you buy the stock, its should create surplus in **value** to make performance 

- **Contrarianism** - be the opposite to the market, "***When they sell, I'm buying, when they buy - i am selling***". But don't misinterpret this with simply "buy what's cheap", not everything that fell comes back 

- **Time horizon** - fundamental and contrary investment **takes time for thesis to play out**. Market often inaccurately determines the value of company's future cash flow at current time point, due to **exogenous** factors   

- **Portfolio concentration** - is required to generate alpha, however key is to manage risk, quantitative and qualitative. Thanks to current technological disruption, short-marco risks may cause short underperformance for a single company 



### Technological Disruption - it may interrupt reversion to the mean(contrarian approach for particular stock), due to paradigm/technology shift

#### It explains statement that "not everything that felt, comes back" 

- Time of technological adoption within the industry has narrowed to **single business cycle**, what on regular basis disrupts the businesses and leaves contrarian strategies in underperformance

- Companies no longer **stay within their industry verticals**. Amazon - fcn everywhere, Google - fcn everywhere. Companies may not notice who disrupts their competitive position 

### Venture Capital - outflow of VC from US to China and RoW. From 88% to less 50% of VC are now based in US 
- Due to huge leverage and paradigm shift, **VC started to stay private much longer** 

- IPO of VC is ***always*** overvalued. VC funds may expect return of 100x. but that is not possible with public markets 

- **Low rates -> Risk Capital ---> Para / De-emphasizing earnings ---> Hurts active investment alpha**



## Generating Alpha

- ### Design the strategy - what are our goals? Not just **as much as possible**, but specifically - into what is our expected return and what is moderated level of risk?
	- Large cap are rarely allow to generate sufficient alpha, **they are too efficient**
	- To generate alpha and avoid **poor** decisions sustain portfolio concentration
	- Your should **never loose money**, avoid looses(like i fcn don't know) 
	- **Set a time horizon** - each strategy requires time to be executed 
	- Stick to the strategy(**you may reevaluate it thou**), **on average ppl get higher returns with their strategy, rather than changing it**

##### Hedge funds managers chasing short-term returns for "yearly bonuses and premiums"

- ### Investment Process:
	- Process should always evolve, if it stagnates - **learning has stopped**. 
	- Add and remove tasks from the process. Try something new, even thou it is useless - **now you know that it is useless**
	- Adjust it to specific scenario. Be reasonable and think outside of the box,  

	- ##### Have a process and follow investing tenets. Understand why you make decisions

	- ##### Repeatable process, construct it and repeat it until perfection 

	- ##### Avoid behavioral biases 
	
	- ##### Analyse historical decisions 
	
	- ##### Avoid the noise, focus on fundamental and actual studies. Speak with experts and avoid opinions of someone who ==wants to engage you into something==
	
	- ##### Take information-advantage. Knowing that snowstorm will be on Black Friday, may be a good chance to ==short retailers==

- ### Security Selection:
	- Selecting a company based **only** on valuation will **not generate superior alpha**. For greater performance **we should find business with good valuation, superior business mode and one which trades for cheap**
	
- #### To identify superior business model look/compare:
	- What type of **metrics** demonstrated superior BM in the past 
	- What type of **companies** are more **apt** to have sustainable **ROE**
	- What type of **companies** can **be quickly deleted from search**
		- **Heavily regulated companies & Dying Industries/companies without expertise** - companies which hold non-cyclical **monopolistic** assets will **not** generate returns over its cost of capital due regulation(**if they do, regulator will shut down the window**). Industries like **utilities, roads and other infrastructure businesses** 

- #### Timing the cycle:
	- Selecting outperformer in disrupted industry where your expertise show paradigm shift **may be a good investment**. However I should understand how industry **manages stages** of market cycle and **what drives it**
			
	- How much **demand on product/service** will **drop/rise** in **downwards/upside** curve?
			
	- How much **CapEx** was **spent/prepared** in the **industry** -> **creating supply capacity during the up cycle**. CapEx intensive companies will surge during bad economic conditions/downward cycle. 
		- *Paradigm shift may make inventory obsolete*
		
		- Is there **rational** competition?
			
		- Will some **businesses go bankrupt, consolidating the industry?**
	
		- Concerned about *roll-ups*

	- Understand the reasons for volatility of **Cash Flow**

- #### Recommended to avoid 
	- Hot stocks with high volatility. They are in on a watch list of hedge funds and momentum investors(NVDA, TSLA). 
	- Highly leveraged(or those with **competitive advantage**) companies in the end of market cycle will suffer from lack of credit and margins

- #### Define the sustainable growth driver, or what lead to that
	- Is there any whitespaces(areas with unharvested growth) or is it mature and businesses have to fight for each dollar with someone else 
		- It may be easier if a company is an industry disruptor or can penetrate the market share 
	- In emerging market it isn't necessary to take market share in competitor, but the demand for the product may be different(BK in Brazil 102 p)

	- ##### Unit growth - business with sustainable competitive advantage tends to have easily ==projected & low CapEx==. In emerging market(==with income and population growth==) where business can create something once and then don't re-invent the wheel to stay competitive is a ==good business==   
		- Once we can project capex, it's much simpler to project revenue growth  

	- ##### Product and sku growth - how much it can scale up without lowering it's margins +Relationships with distribution channels 
		- Does channels have a negotiation power? Where are they located? Can they intimidate in happen

	- ##### Vertical industry growth - expanding from one vertical to another(industry) much tougher and unpredictable. Business like `Saleforces` provide best-in-industry ==solutions, but most companies don't==  

	- ##### Best in Class human-capital - company which build ==culture== and therefore attacks talented individuals(Goldman Sachs) has a competitive advantage. ==BUT== it's hard to determine and more often it's centered over single person(Elon, Steve) 

	- ##### Future investing - high expectation; valuation; volatility is ==not== a combination for sustainable success
		- Pioneer of entirely new market(most often VC) which is just **suppose** to exist, is **most often** a bad idea. Unless you an expertise 

- #### Operating Margins
	1. ***Will operating margins increase with sales?
	2. ***Where is the business model leverage?***
	3. ***How sustainable margin improvements?***

	- Betting on **increasing margins(optimize its operations**) in company which has a brand or some-kind of competitive advantage **will generate alpha
		- **Increased margins(8% -> 14%) === doubled FCF margin -> doubled value over time**
	- *G&A - will naturally grow with increased revenue, in rare cases may be improved* 
	- Customer satisfaction/Sales without leveraging S&A -> lever advertising expenses === competitive advantage  



- ### To build a thesis, there should ==be an area for improvement== or ==discount==
	- #### Context: company is ==inefficient== and seeking areas of improvement; is in struggling industry/sector; there is an economic headwind *ahead*; crisis is behind - now we analyze recovery position;
		- Company can improve by **a) reinvesting better/tremendously faster, b) use their assets more efficiently**
	- #### Questions:
		
		- How well does company manage its existing assets?
			- *Cashflow from existing assets; Cashflow before debt payment, but after taxes and maintenance of exist assets*
		
		- Are you investing optimally for future growth?
			- *Growth from new investments; Growth created by making new investments; function of amount and quality of investment*
		
		- Room to utilize existing assets better?
			- Growth generated by use of existing assets
		
		- How long can it be sustainable; within competition, industry, sector and economy?
			- Durability of competitive advantage and sustainability of fundamentals
		
		- Right amount and *kind* of debt/leverage?
- #### Depending on those questions we can build investment thesis and model our target price better
