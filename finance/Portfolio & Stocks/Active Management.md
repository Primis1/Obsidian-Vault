### Terms Recognition:

### Concepts:
- Corporate Venture Funds 
- Roll up - merging of multiple small companies within the industry into one company  

#### Alpha with hedge fund managers 
- Over last 15 years HF's generated alpha declined, from 50% of outperforming HF M to just 20% in 2025

- It has relation to interest rates - the cheaper the money, the better overall index performs, the more pressure is on HF  

- Psychological Pressure:
	- Underperformance creates **outflow** of cash from HF 
	- More pressure creates more **short-term decisions**
	- Such decisions create poor performance and **then**
	- **Outflow** of cash from HF
#### Interest Rates

- Since 2010th, alpha potential got weaker than its historical figures

- It relates with low interest rates, which boost **even poor business into competitive advantage**

- Passive investments are forced to invest into equity, due to **low bond yield**. Creating demand for risk assets 
- Lengthen **business cycle**(short-debt/credit **cycle described by Ray Dalio**)

#### Investment ==tenets==
- Goal **congruence** & **fiduciary** - trust people you work with. If management is shady - skip it. There are much more opportunities 

- **Invest in Fundamentals** - avoid behavioral mistakes and dig deep into analyzing fundamentals AND **business operations** 

- **Future valuation** - after you buy the stock, its should create surplus in **value** to make performance 

- **Contrarianism** - be the opposite to the market, "***When they sell, I'm buying, when they buy - i am selling***". But don't misinterpret this with simply "buy what's cheap", not everything that fell comes back 

- **Time horizon** - fundamental and contrary investment **takes time for thesis to play out**. Market often inaccurately determines the value of company's future cash flow at current time point, due to **exogenous** factors   

- **Portfolio concentration** - is required to generate alpha, however key is to manage risk, quantitative and qualitative. Thanks to current technological disruption, short-marco risks may cause short underperformance for a single company 



### Technological Disruption - it may interrupt reversion to the mean(contrarian approach for particular stock), due to paradigm/technology shift

#### It explains statement that "not everything that felt, comes back" 

- Time of technological adoption within the industry has narrowed to **single business cycle**, what on regular basis disrupts the businesses and leaves contrarian strategies in underperformance

- Companies no longer **stay within their industry verticals**. Amazon - fcn everywhere, Google - fcn everywhere. Companies may not notice who disrupts their competitive position 

### Venture Capital - outflow of VC from US to China and RoW. From 88% to less 50% of VC are now based in US 
- Due to huge leverage and paradigm shift, **VC started to stay private much longer** 

- IPO of VC is ***always*** overvalued. VC funds may expect return of 100x. but that is not possible with public markets 

- **Low rates -> Risk Capital ---> Para / De-emphasizing earnings ---> Hurts active investment alpha**



## Generating Alpha

- ### Design the strategy - what are our goals? Not just **as much as possible**, but specifically - into what is our expected return and what is moderated level of risk?
	- Large cap are rarely allow to generate sufficient alpha, **they are too efficient**
	- To generate alpha and avoid **poor** decisions sustain portfolio concentration
	- Your should **never loose money**, avoid looses(like i fcn don't know) 
	- **Set a time horizon** - each strategy requires time to be executed 
	- Stick to the strategy(**you may reevaluate it thou**), **on average ppl get higher returns with their strategy, rather than changing it**

##### Hedge funds managers chasing short-term returns for "yearly bonuses and premiums"

- ### Investment Process:
	- Process should always evolve, if it stagnates - **learning has stopped**. 
	- Add and remove tasks from the process. Try something new, even thou it is useless - **now you know that it is useless**
	- Adjust it to specific scenario. Be reasonable and think outside of the box,  

	- ##### Have a process and follow investing tenets. Understand why you make decisions

	- ##### Repeatable process, construct it and repeat it until perfection 

	- ##### Avoid behavioral biases 
	
	- ##### Analyse historical decisions 
	
	- ##### Avoid the noise, focus on fundamental and actual studies. Speak with experts and avoid opinions of someone who ==wants to engage you into something==
	
	- ##### Take information-advantage. Knowing that snowstorm will be on Black Friday, may be a good chance to ==short retailers==

- ### Security Selection:
	- Selecting a company based **only** on valuation will **not generate superior alpha**. For greater performance **we should find business with good valuation, superior business mode and one which trades for cheap**
	
	- #### To identify superior business model look/compare:
		- What type of **metrics** demonstrated superior BM in the past 
		- What type of **companies** are more **apt** to have sustainable **ROE**
		- What type of **companies** can **be quickly deleted from search**
			- **Heavily regulated companies & Dying Industries/companies without expertise** - companies which hold non-cyclical **monopolistic** assets will **not** generate returns over its cost of capital due regulation(**if they do, regulator will shut down the window**). Industries like **utilities, roads and other infrastructure businesses** 

	- #### Timing the cycle:
		- Selecting outperformer in disrupted industry where your expertise show paradigm shift **may be a good investment**. However I should understand how industry **manages stages** of market cycle and **what drives it**
			
			- How much **demand on product/service** will **drop/rise** in **downwards/upside** curve?
			
			- How much **CapEx** was **spent/prepared** in the **industry** -> **creating supply capacity during the up cycle**. CapEx intensive companies will surge during bad economic conditions/downward cycle. 
				- *Paradigm shift may make inventory obsolete*
			
			- Is there **rational** competition?
			
			- Will some **businesses go bankrupt, consolidating the industry?**
	
			- Concerned about *roll-ups*
		- Understand the reasons for volatility of **Cash Flow**


- #### Create ***buy and sell target*** 

- #### **Invest**
