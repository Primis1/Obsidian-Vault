### Terms Recognition:
1. Competitive advantage - giving business **steadiness during times of turbulence** and **ability to generate** **alpha**
	1. It comes from "consistency" & "durability" which we can find in fin statements
	2. Presence/Absence and combination of both can **indicate** that behind company's performance we can see **competitive advantage**

	3. Risk - chance of underperforming 
			1. Always should be higher for **greater returns**
### Concepts:

#### Value of the business is value its future cash-flows, i.e earnings power. CA provides reliability of those CF and its lusting
- Macro/Micro hazards may be facilitated or mitigated by competitive advantage and lower risk of investment

### Consistency in each of metric is crucial. ==Company can sustains its metrics for a reason== 

## Competitive Advantage Across Fin-Statements:

### Income Statement 
- ##### Gross Profit - high and consistent of above 40% indicate its superiority, below 20% position in highly competitive industry, and between just mediocre
	- Margins can be eaten by **Operating Expenses**(Interest from debt, R&D, S&A)
	
- ##### Operating Expenses:
	- **S&A** - all direct & indirect selling expenses; Such as: salaries, **advertising**, travel costs, commissions, etc
	
	- **R&D** -  inventing/designing new technologies/patents which **may give company a sustainable advantage(SIMO is ahead of the game rn)**, but if they don't put money into - **they will vanish** 

	- **Depreciation** - period charges for PP&E, **but cash goes upfront**. The lower depreciation cost as % of gross profits - the better 
		- Maybe be foolish to ignore, consider that everything should be replaced at some point. Most horrible is that heavily invested firms may experience **outdating of their machinery**
	
	- **interest Expenses** - the less the better, indicates that there is no need for debt, due to **a) big earnings power, b) good scalability c) low CapEx requirements**
		- **It's credit rating and interest % is important**
		- **Expensiveness of debt demonstrated its consequences back in 2007**

	- "**All other**" include non-recurring expenses 


- ##### Net Income/Earnings - consistent upwards(may not be smooth) trend indicates good competitive position
	- Profit margin is obviously important
	
	- **Consistent EPS growth is also a plus**
- ##### ROIC - when company has growth, their investments should be efficient
 
### Balance Sheet
- ##### Business should have a "pile up" cash that helps it operating and indicates surplus. To get more money it can:
	- Issue bonds, which creates a heap before it was put to use
	
	- Selling business or assets 

	- From its operations  
- **Current ratio** - maybe useful and not; with enough earning power, business may not hold too much cash to pay its debt 
- **PP&E** - in bad economic conditions, there **won't be enough cash to purchase new "heavy equipment"**, therefore business **will likely turn to debt**

- ##### Retained Earnings - sum of money which are left after paying dividends or buybacks
	- Company's net growth 

	- Treasury Stock - repurchased shares after buyback program

	- Having shareholder's yield is **great**

### Cash-Flow Statement 
- ##### CapEx - spends on long term investments. Having consistently low CapEx - good 
	- The less you have - the less D&A you pay, the more Working capital you have 
	- Distinguishing **growth** and **maintenance** capex can give an indicator of **outperformance**


## Risk and Assessment : 

### Potter's Forces:
- ![[Pasted image 20250320224818.png]]
- ##### Pricing power and cost structure - ability to increase prices in ==something==, indicates competitive advantage
	- *Customer's cost structure is important for every business, and their surplus in money IS important even for staples when considering rivals in industry verticals*
	- If **CCS** is 10$, your product is 1 $; increase of 10% -> 1.1 $ **will be easier to implement**. **Ideally, product should not be a huge part of their cost structure** 
- ##### Intangibles - should be assessed on brand, infrastructure and patents
	- ##### In IT, high `intangible` to `total-assets` -> might indicate strong intellectual property.
		- Example with CRGO, how their entire business was valued in 10 m, while competitor used 10 x the same value for their platform 

	- Patents expire, work only in law-strict governments(China can copy-paste if they really want) +they are profitable as much as **government allows it to be**. I.e, policies should be monitored

	- Brand power can be assessed by surveys and pricing strategies

- ##### Switching costs - equipment for labs... Docs're used to machines from Illumina and not likely to switch for something else
	- It may be costly, but new technologies may **force the switch and/or make it less painful**
	- ==Switching allow pricing power==
	
- ##### **Domino** **Effect** - when each new user/customer adds another one
	- In PM work for DE was already done, therefor business expects to receive benefits from those investments
	- In VC **it does not work**, customer base haven't reach that point yet
	- Hard to build and assess, ***but example: LinkedIn, won a competition and each member brings another into the club -> causing relience  -> switching costs ---> simultaneous bringing new customers(Domino effect) 

- ##### Barriers of entry which protect ==growth== - there maybe a barrier, but there are no growth. KO hasn't grown for decade behind their massive barriers. 
	- **Barrier are made for decline protection, but not for growth production**


### Management - with size, influence of management decreases


#### Forecast of growth from Income and Cash flow statement, Risk from balance sheet
- The detailed the process, the better a process is
- In case of growth-driver change -> investment should be **sold**

### Debt Serving Coverage Ratio(DSCR) - how company earnings power can cover its debt payments(taken from conference)
- **DSCR = Net Operating Income(EBITDA) / total debt in service(interest payment and principal)** 
- Often pairs with strong working capital
