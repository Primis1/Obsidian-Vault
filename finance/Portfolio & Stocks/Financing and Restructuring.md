#### Restructuring causes:

#### Negotiation with lender:
1. Equity Injection 
2. Interest payment only 
3. Extend the amortization 

#### CCAA(Companies' Creditor Arrangement Act) - helps large, insolvent companies restructuring their debt to ==avoid bankruptcy== 
- Company applies to court for protection -> issues "stay of processing" to halt creditor's action
#### Chapter 11 - like in Canada, US court gives business a protection from creditors to reorganize its debt 


#### Bankruptcy Filling - outstanding debt is bigger than value of entire business
- Business is selling by the value of its debt
#### Chapter 7 - US bankruptcy version
