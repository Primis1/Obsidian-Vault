### Terms Recognition:
- Internal/External order & disorder
- Money & Credit cycle 
- Prisoner's Dilemma - game theory, if both cooperate -> 1 year; if one confesses -> 10 years for another; if both confesses -> 5 years each; 
	- **it often play with between the countries, because countries often seek to exterminate another party, in case of existential threat, rather than resolving the problem**  
### Concepts:

- *Like with stages in **cancer**, in cycles actions which were done in one stage have influence on probabilities in another* 

## Internal Order Cycle 
### Stage 1

- **New Order, new leadership** - usually period after the war when **leaders** **take** **everything** from losers 
	- Revolutions comes in two parts - bring down the established leader, **slaughter all who were loyal to previous order**, fight for power within your group - i.e a **purge** 
	- Leader who do best during this stage are usually **consolidators of power**, which focus on **rebuilding assets and stability**

### Stage 2

- **New bureaucracies are build and/or refined** - **early prosperity** stage
	- To be successful in this stage, established order must provide prosperity for **most people(especially middle class)** and have course in the same direction(**people should think about same thing**)
	- Besides intelligence and leadership, leaders need to be "**civil engineers**", **who can pull the country through stage 1,2 and 3**

### Stage 3

- **Period of peace and prosperity** - time when those who can imagine and convey a picture of future world that **never** existed before
	- Those who inspired can **implement** that picture into reality
	- People are **productive**, have **low** **debt**, **good relationship with neighbors** 

### Stage 4

- **Excess in spendings & debt and growing gap in wealth** - **beginning of decadence**  
	- Old leaders/regime is the only thing that keeps herd productive...
	- However, mostly fails, due to temptation of spending more and unfavor of going against the mass

### Stage 5

- **When there are terrible financial conditions** - **expenses are larger than revenue**. Various factors with its **cost and affects**. Raising taxes and cutting expenses, or mass money printing and debt paying from those money 
	- Country is the image of its people, if they're in bad fin conditions - country is as well
	- Large income and wealth gaps
	- Sever **negative** economic shock 

	- Locations with toughest conditions, likely have greatest conflicts
		- Cutting expenses and raising taxes in places with large wealth gaps - ***led civil wars/revolutions of some kind**
	
	- **Averages doesnt matter** - what matter is the **quantity of people** who suffer and **their power** 

	- **Raising of Populism** - during wealth gaps there is always someone who "***fights you and me***". The more such individuals and movements are, **the deeper it is into stage 5**
	- **Bureaucracy** - the more complex and less effective it gets, the slower is rate of decision making  -> the more struggles are there  
	- **Loss of Truth in the Public Domain** - lack of reliable news resource due to increased propaganda(despite new era - **people are still morons**) 
	- **Stubbornism within country** - when people cherish their causes, more than reasonable decisions, it leads to -> positional bargaining -> **==failure== of positional bargaining**      
### Stage 6

- **Civil war and revolutions** - fight between those who want redistribution of wealth, against those who do not.
	- Commonly have influence of other countries, which incline/bend the course of revolution in their favor
	- Beginning of **civil wars** are unclear at the start, but clear when it passing to/though middle stage


Those Cycles naturally repeat themselves, each cycle often lasts 70-90 years on average 


## External Order
- Different from internal by its rather straightforwardness - *who got more wealth(wealth == power)* dominates all other. Even unions like United Nations, EU, etc.

#### Types of conflicts 
- **Trade/economic war** - conflict or putting pressure through **tariffs**, import/export restrictions

- **Technological war** - conflict over **patents**, or which technology can be protected from production/replication and which are not

- **Geopolitical war** - *not violent* conflict over territory and alliances, won/lost through **negotiation** or **commitment**

- **Capital wars** - imposed through financial tools such as **sanctions** and/or **limiting access to capital or certain market** 

- **Military wars** - "**Please don't shoot! I did already...**"


*In most scenarios, most terrible war appears when both countries have **existential reasons for a fight**. However "stupid" wars still happen, when country will loose much more from the conflict than it will gain after/maybe it wins === **retarded wars***
 - One war tends to produce another; Economic \War -> Military War
#### People always choose the conflict in under bad circumstances


#### Market Drivers: ==growth, risk premium, discount rate and inflation==

### Monetary Cycles 
- Country goes from **intrinsic money -> claims on intrinsic money -> claims without intrinsic back up, which hold solely on faith in the currency** 
- During third stage, country tends to print **a lot of money** which devalues the currency, but debt as well. Usually recession, default or restructuring is followed by it
