### Special values:

- #yield-curve - associated with economic recession and overall optimism/pessimism on the market. Curve displays correlation of interest rates and bond maturities of bonds

### Concepts:

#### Base case:
- Bonds with longer maturities have higher yields than those with shorter

- Y - rate paid; X - years of coupon 

##### Inversion - when short-term interest rates of bonds, exceed long-term

- Indicates that investors seeking safer option, choose long-term bonds, hence dumping their yield. 
	- Indicates uncertainty/fear in short term market 

##### Rates - we can predict what market expects from FED; what rates they will imply  

#### ==Normal== Yield Curve - rates grow bigger with maturity and after some age get flat; normal time/reward correlation
- 2 y bond offers a yield of 1%;
- 5 y bond offers a yield of 1.8%;
- 10 y bond offers a yield of 2.5%
- 15 y bond offers a yield of 3.0%
- 20 y bond offers a yield of 3.5%.
*Make a graph by connecting those points and you get **normal** yield curve

#### ==Steep== Yield Curve - same as normal, but don't flattens after long term
- Explained by good economic conditions toward a positive upturn. ==With high interest rates and high inflation== 
	- Because of that, lender tends to demand a higher yield to catch up with inflation

#### ==Flat== Yield Curve - *flat*, implies in uncertain economic conditions
- May appear after economic expansion and lead to inverted curve which indicates fear and high inflation 
- Investors demand same yield over all maturities 

#### Inverted Yield Curve - indicates that short-term interests are higher than long term
- Indicates recession and/or severe economic conditions
- Coupons may look like:
	- 2 y bond offers a yield of 5%;
	- 5 y bond offers a yield of 4.5%;
	- 10 y bond offers a yield of 4%
	- 15 y bond offers a yield of 3.5%

#### Cyclical vs Non-Cyclical investments
- If curve is inverting, good option is non-cyclical businesses and opposite when yield curve steeps
