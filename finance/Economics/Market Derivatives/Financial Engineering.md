### Concepts:

#### Discrete random variables:
- Cumulative Distribution Function (`CDF`) - explains the probability that random variable ==X== is < or == to `value x` $$F(x)=P(X≤x)$$
- Probability mass function (`PMF`) - give probability of ==X== being a specific value in `set A` $$P(X∈A)=∑_{x∈A}​p(x)$$
- Expected Value (EV) - calculates "returns" from weighted probability over extended time period $$E[X]=∑_{i}x_ip(xi)$$
