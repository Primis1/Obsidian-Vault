#### Stock spread categories from #value to #growth
1. Value Stocks - buy stocks which are on sale at the current moment, and sell them when they reach their actual value. 

2. Dividend-Paying Stocks - investing in something that has high dividend yield 

3. Timing Economical Sensitive Stocks - buying/selling cyclical stocks in different economy *circles*. 
	- When economy enters recession, cyclical companies will decrease in sells and cash income, therefore #P/E **multiple increases**, but stock value decreases (`counter intuitive`)

4. Growth at a Reasonable Price Stock - stock which trade with reasonable/low #P/E, but with high #growth ration. Relies on future growth rate, it GR is questionable, then company is questionable for investing 
	- Emphasises  the companies with PEG ( #P/E / Growth Ration ), about 1 one less 

5. Growth Stock - investing in stock which have above average, in sector, growth rates of `sales/earings`.  What usually causes a high #P/E ratio. 
	- it is kinda expectations market, because stocks get punished if their growth rate are declining
