- Current CF and Income 
- Market/Economic outlook 
- Specialized issues within business/industry

### How country fights debt crisis? 
- Austerity - spend less than they borrow

#### Affect of money devaluation
1. Debt is someone else's assets, therefore, by holding an assets with returns lesser than its devaluation -> debtor looses money
2. The lower interest rates and higher inflation, the less surrounding people have belief in fiat currency  -> the faster transition to **reserve** or **change in reserve currency *is***
