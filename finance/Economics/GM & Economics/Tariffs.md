### Terms Recognition:
- Tariffs - ***tax on imports, used to protect domestic producers/industries***, in exchange to lose of globalization benefits, such as outsource of work, materials and manufacturers form less developed countries 
	- Political instrument used under bad economic conditions. Tariffs contribute to greater economic weakness due to sacrifice of globalization efficiency. **Often create a political support for those who impose tariffs **
### Concepts:

#### Micro effects:
- Business which rely more on global markets and trade, will get a severe damage from:
	- Disruption of logistic chain
	- Loss of competitive advantage and gross margins 
	- International tensions(**trade war**)
- **Reduce of consumers buying power**
- **Beaten up equity valuation in devastated countries; ==Deals from 20-100m dollars on 70-80% consists from US buy side==**

#### Macro effects:
- Increasing inflation and reduced imports 
- Lower economic growth and productivity 
	- US may loose **0,4% of GDP growth from tariffs, Canada may loose 2%**
	- **Where fat will lean up, skinny will die**
- Disruption in sectors like **electronics** & **machinery(Cars & Equipment)**, what lowers consumers buying power(no money - Consumer Discretionary suffers)
- **Trade Balance aligning**
- Fastens nearshore, forces companies open local fabrics   

### Value drivers:

#### Expected FCFF drivers =  
- ##### Greater threat to companies foreign sales - *revenue growth*, ==function of total accessible market & market share== 
- ##### Capital intensive(depends on a cheap labor) - *growth/investment efficiency*, ==measures how much investments business is required for its operations==
- ##### International supply chain ==reliance== - *operating margins*, ==pricing power of businesses==


#### Risk-Adjustments:
- Bigger pressure on leveraged business
	- WARREN IS RIGHT. Tariffs, disasters, macro-economic tensions - cataclysm in which businesses with good competitive advantage are sealing through, while ***bad businesses sink***  
- ##### Higher Cost of Equity - rate of returns that investors demands
- ##### Cost of Debt - cost of borrowed money; Tariffs add to inflation -> what rises interest rates -> what lowers equity premiums over risk free-rate; higher effect on riskier & highly-leveraged firms 

### Move towards smaller "local" companies which are really-really good at narrow field; `Broad, Large cap` -> `Niche, Small cap` businesses
