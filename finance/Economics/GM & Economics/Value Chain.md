	1. Companies have to generate better value from each transaction by optimising their **value-chain** 
2. Value chain analysis - determines how each process adds/removes value from end product/services - **understand areas which can improve and what can interfere these improvements**
	1. Mainly focuses on **a) cost reduction b) product quality**

### Concepts:

#### Division on primary and secondary activities
- All of these are aimed to create margin, between provided value or rather **surplus** in value created by company. If it provides little value, **margins are low -> cash flows are low**

#### Conduction of value chain

##### 1. Identify Value Chain Activities - determine all primary and secondary activities that go into product creation 

##### 2. Determine Activities' Values and Costs - determine what value each activity adds and costs of adding that value:
- How does each step increases consumer's satisfaction?
- How does it creates value for firm?
- Does investing into product design makes it substantially upgrades quality?

##### 3. Identify Competitive Advantage Opportunities - see the business through goals - leverage quality or cut costs? 
- Both provide value for customers, but **some would work better in time period(Margins vs Volumes  dilemma)**. Will the business benefit a lot from slight decrease in margins?

#### Reasons of company prosperity - ==Cost Reduction && Quality Improvements== === higher margins -> more cash
