### What you have, minus what you owe = what you *worth*:

- #### ==Assets== - resources owned or controlled by company; Assets class can changed over time; *other assets => fixed assets* 

	- ##### ==Current assets== (expected to convert into cash or used within a year):
		- **Cash** **and** **Cash** **Equivalent** - amount of current cash company has
		
		- **Receivable** - enforced **claims** for payment held by business, for goods or services that ordered, but money not in yet in the bank 
			 - Account receivable - obligations of customers of a company for goods which are shipped to 'em by credit 

		- **Inventory** - both finished products, which are ready to sale, and materials to be made into products; **manufacturing salaries**;
			- when finished goods are sold, it becomes an **account receivables**
			- all manufacturing costs go into **inventory**
		
		- **Pre-paid expenses** - pre-paid bills. Insurance, phone calls, rent, salaries advances   
			- added to current assets, coz company will not pay for it in near future   
		
		- **#Working-Capital** - money/cash left for business after subtracting  #Current-liabilities and current-assets 
			- #Working-Capital is money business is going to work in short term. Feeding operations with bills
			- Net current assets && Funds - are same as #Working-Capital 


	*Current assets can be called "working assets", due to their constant **asset cycle**;: 
		cash -> inventory -> when sold becomes account receivable -> upon collection becomes **cash***

	- ##### ==Non-Current assets:==
		
		- **PP&E** - Property, Plants & Equipment, which are necessary for company's functionality. Equipment for producing goods 
		
		- **Long-term Investments** - assets which are held for future growth (more than a year)


	 *Assets which are used for business to maintain its function, and which are not considered to have high #liquidity*

- #### Liability - responsibilities of company. what company `owes`, obligations to pay, deliver goods, contracted services  
	
	- ##### #Current-liabilities (within 1 year):
		- **Account payable** - cost of goods, for use in company. Often purchased from another business and must be paid soon. Cash that we owe, and must pay in near future to keep business operating
		
		- **Short-term debt** - borrowing due within one year, such as loans   
		
		- **Accrued expenses** -  salaries
		
		- Portion of **Long Term Debt**
		
		- **Income Taxes** - paid to government each time company makes profit on sales
			- It's paid each quarter, hence  it is a liability which will be paid
	
	- ##### Long Term Liabilities:
		- Long term debt / Notes Payable - mortgage for houses, machinery, land, etc 
		
		- Accrued expenses / deferred revenue - good or services to be **delivered after 1 year**
		
		- Other Non-Current Liabilities: Long-term obligations not categorised above.

- #### Equity (net cash after liquidating all liabilities)
	- **Shareholders** #equity - money which are left from assets, after paying all liabilities
		- owner's #equity, net-worth - are the same things   
		- Increases with #net-income 
	
	- Common stock / Share capital - value of shares issued to common shareholder 
	
	- Preferred stock - shares with preferred rights to dividends or liquidating 
	
	- Additional Paid In Capital - amount shareholders paid above nominal share value. Shows extra value contributed by shareholders 
	
	- Retained earnings - cumulative profit retained in the business after dividends. It reflects the company's reinvestment of profits


### What to look at:
- **Assets level relative to sales volume indicates:**
	- **Efficiency of company's investments(machinery and inventory) generate revenue** 


#### Liquidity Ratios:
- **Current Ratio -** ratio determines, that the current assets are enough to cover current liabilities
	- Ratio of 1.1, means that company *just* meets the upcoming payment  
	- Value above 2, considered good for manufacturing company $$\frac{current assets}{current liabilities} = 2.7$$
- **Quick Ratio** - same as **Current Ratio**, but excludes inventory
	- $$\frac{cash + receivables}{current liabilities} = 1.9$$
- **Assets turn** - ratio that measure how much profit/assets it can generate
	- Indicates how much investments company requires to raise its sales$$\frac{annual sales}{assets} = 1.0$$
	- High turns indicates that company can expand sales with low investments


#### Leverage ratios:
- **Debt-to-** #equity  **Ratio** - shows how much **debt** company has, relative to its investors #equity 
	- Indicates that debt can be repaid, no matter what $$\frac{C/L \text{ Debt}}{\text{Shareholders Equity}} = 0.5$$
- **Debt** **Ratio** - debt to total assets  
	- Indicates the operating leverage$$\frac{C/L \text{ Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}} = 0.3$$
