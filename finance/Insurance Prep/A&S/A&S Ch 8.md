### Group plans - members are covered without med underwriting, therefore insurer should collect data about:

#### Makeup of the group - composite identity of the group is used to determine coverage +premiums. Dealing with numbers, age and gender +turnover rate 
1. More ppl allow volume discount. 25+
2. Age/Gender influences flexibility of benefits and coverage 
3. Lesser turnover rate provides more consistency and predictability - higher rate = longer waiting period and higher premiums 
#### Nature of business - high hazardous, physical work environment will be charged a higher premiums
1. However even white collar jobs can be stressful and therefore fall under the same umbrella
2. Industry analysis will help gather data during assessment process (comparative lines of work)
3. Employee sheets provided to insurer can include:
	1. Date of birth 
	2. Gender 
	3. Occupation class(executive vs manual workers)
	4. List of dependents

##### Benefits related to psychological, med health or retirement are tax free but for legal or fin advice are *in fact* taxable income 

#### Plan member enrollment - can be half-mandatory by the employer. If that's so benefits are equal for everyone
1. Specific period for enrollment is present(30-60 days)
