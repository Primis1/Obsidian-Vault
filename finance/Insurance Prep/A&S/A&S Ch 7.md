### Fuck Ups:
1. 
***
### Recommendations consideration:
1. Basis of recommendations - starts with assessing client profile(Debt, Net worth Cashflow statements +med underwriting)
	1. After needs and available option analysis. Current coverage is assessed, in case of any gaps, current contract should be modified to catch needs 
2. Recommendation to manage premiums - A&S have higher premiums due to high claim rate
	1. Extending waiting period, shortening benefit period and changing the coverage --> lower policy benefit --> lower premiums 
	2. Policy nature - from non-cancellable -> guaranteed renewable with the same coverage and criteria 
3. Head-office modification for non-standard risk - admin costs are included into policy, based on probability of claim(work required)
	1. Standard Insurable risk 
	2. Non-standard 
	3. Uninsurable (decline)
	4. To avoid Uninsurable rating, insurer can apply:
		1. Exclusion, Limits, Rating the premiums - allows to control client risk exposure and compensate insurer 
		2. Deductible claims - most common in **extended health**, however applicable to other A&S
4. Providing quotes - present only one solution/contract/policy **or** two **but different**
5. Documenting the recommendation - keep records to protect myself 
	1. Helps to navigate and secured agent from client's expectations(type + amount of insurance he needs; insurance he can qualify; his health conditions; cost of product(premium))
	2. Client file should contain: 
		1. Record of expectations 
		2. Record of agent taking those considerations into account 
6. Presenting complementary policies - explain coverage gaps and propose solutions 
7. Revising the recommendation - cant be "take it or leave it". Agent is **obligated** to provide the most suitable and right solution which aligns with interest of client.
	1. If offer is not accepted, contract should be restructured to suit needs 

***
### Application - core stone of the issue process, evaluation and investigation of needs & health of an application is based, initially, on the info provided during application formation 

##### Attention to Details - agent is legally responsible to file application on client's behalf correctly and completely, before forwarding to underwriting department 
- Inaccurate/incomplete info filed by an agent can **at least** delay the issue of policy **at worst lead to decline(although by insured is initially qualified)**
	- In that case law suit against agent for misrepresentation can begin

##### Particular attention and details required on application
1. Product type and coverage details - 
2. Owner, life insured beneficiary 
	1. In personal income replacement beneficiary and policyholder are the same ppl(usually), but in case of business beneficiary should be stated(for practical and tax reasons)
3. Premiums 
4. Riders 

#### Agent acts as mere recorder of an information provided by client. However he can make a proactive actions(although not required). Also agent can describe his impression about client. Agent intervenes into: 
1. Agent's comment - important information or impression made by the application to the agent. It's a free-form report that helps explain or expand "answers from the box"
	1. Agent can inform that client intends to quit current employment, which will reduced his income for next few year. Client expects a raise in next few month, statement of "non-smoker" but agent feels stink of cigarettes
2. Medical Questions - expand the answer and adjust it to file the form and make it easier for underwriting department to interpret 
3. Inspection report - not related to job of an agent, but usual practice to seek data from third-party(by underwriting department)
4. Hazardous Sports and occupation duties - details about activity(discretionary & occupation related), alcohol and drug usage and frequency of such activities

#### After answering income question application can be require to provide most recent T4 and T5 slips, or T1. 
- Companies require more than 1 year of reports, 3 years +

#### Replacing existing coverage requires client's understanding of benefits +form that confirms that. Compared data on form
1. Premiums 
2. Covered condition 
3. Excluded causes of disability 
4. Riders and Other benefits  
5. Expiration of coverage 
6. Waiting & benefit period 
7. Definition of covered conditions 

***
### Insurer assess risk in two ways:
1. Financial - verify applicant's income level, to determine max level of coverage and ability to pay premiums 
2. Medical - if client qualifies for the insurance 


#### Affecting premiums:
1. Administrative costs
2. Investment return - generated by investing capital reserves, higher return = higher premiums 
3. Laspe rates - higher lapse rates = less claims = lower premiums 
4. Morbidity rate - higher chance to file a claim = higher premium 
5. Rating and exclusion - ratings are a higher premiums for **"non-standard"** risk 


#### Med underwriting - info is taken from Medical Insurance Bureau(MIB) to assess the risk and insurability of a client
1. Ensures cross-information for single application among insurance companies 
##### Attending Physician Statement - input from personal doctor
1. Such request is made automatically by underwriting department in case of unclear/suspicious answers on med statement 

***

### Contract 
#### After weeks or month for new application, policy is send to an agent who will then deliver the policy to the client 
- 10 days lock for newly issued policies. Begins are contract is physically delivered to the owner
- Agent **must** check that fin nor medical state of the applicant have changed 
- If answer is "yes" policy should not be delivered but rather send for reassessment with new notes about negative changes 

#### Clarity about definitions & exclusions - should be beat into head of insured ("heart failure" doesn't necessary cover pain in heart area)


#### Changes to policy + request of sup provision can require face-to-face meeting with an agent 
1. FPO - can be added to insurance policy 
2. Conversion - has a period of 31 days after insured exits the group to convert it into individual policy

***

### Claim process - agent should be careful in managing conflict of interest if helping insured file a claim form. Claim process:
1. insured notifies insurance company or representative(agent) of the event
2. Insurance company provides insured with form, by mail or by agent 
3. Insured must complete the claim, include supplementary information if needed
	1. Forward it to insurance company 
4. Insurer may seek further info, through interview, physician statement, test or exam 

##### Mostly insurer require to file the claim within 30 days, but never more than 6 month

##### Benefits are determined based on med and fin underwriting during claim process 
- Therefore benefit may be lesser than stated in contract

***
### Agents service role:
1. Providing a claim forms and relevant document 
	1. Change or add beneficiary 
	2. Elect an option available under the contract 
	3. Advice insurer of change in address
	4. File a claim; Filling all the above can be assisted by agent 
2. Prompt and accurate - don't delay delivery or provision of services 
3. Strategy for client's awareness and needs - semi-annual or annual contact with client(mail or email) +in person check-up once a year
4. Determine suitability of recommendation - 
5. Document services - keeps notes on dates, words said and action made 
6. Staying in touch on annual or semi-annual basis
