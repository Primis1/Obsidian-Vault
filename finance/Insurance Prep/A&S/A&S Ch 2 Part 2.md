### Fuck Ups:

***
### Terms Recognition:

### Taxation of A&S - in general benefits are tax free, but premiums are *not* tax deductible. Policies taken out by companies *aren't*
- If employer purchases an A&S coverage and pays premiums, while employee is a beneficiary = benefits are **taxable** from insured 

#### Conversion of policy - right to convert a term policy into a permanent life policy with the same insurer without medical underwriting
- Or group to individual LI. **Must be done within 30 days after termination**

### Types of Group DI policies 
- STD - short term disability. Provided for disabilities/injuries duration of less than a year; often play a role as additional coverage for standard DI contract 
	- Based on % of salary. 
	- Benefits are taxable income
	- Benefits tend to be in 70-75% range
	- "Disability" - often stands as "own occupation"
		- "Own Occupation" in group insurance has the same principle as "regular occupation" in individual coverage 
		- I.e, employee can choose to accept an offer from related job, but lose benefits in the process
		- **7 days waiting period**
		- Maximum benefit is, almost always, **12 month**
	- **Can be changed to LTD, if disabled for over 12 month**

- **LTD** - takes over when STD expires. 
	- I.e: **waiting period is duration of benefits for STD**
	- Payable for period of 2-5 years, benefits are 50-60% 
	- **Tax free**
	- **After coverage is in force** - **"Disability"** is defined as **"any occupation"**

#### Plan enrollment - maintenance of records and assessment of new application is duty of plan *administrator*
- There is a **qualification** period on employment itself. Specific number of days before application can join a group plan. **Tied to probation period**  
- **Premium payments** - employee makes monthly payment to insurance company 
	- It's done for the convenience, one payment instead of hundreds from each employee
- Termination Process
	- Master contract is terminated 
	- Member is not an employee anymore
	- Cease to applicable for "membership"
	- Retirement 

#### Benefit amount is restricted by:
1. Non-evidence maximum - basic amount paid regardless of insurability or medical underwriting 
2. Maximum overall amount, based on percentage of member's income - maximum a month is stated in contract. Insured is paid whatever is less 
3. All source maximum. Governed by group offset rules in master contract - in case employee has group and individual coverage, it **restricts to have more than stated amount and any surplus will be offset from group policy**

#### Taxation of GP - benefits received by the employee are taxed
- Premiums paid by the employee are business expenses, therefore - tax deductible 
- **It depends solely on who is paying the premiums, if employee - benefits are tax free**
#### In case both employee and 'er contributing to premiums - employee's benefits are *tax free* refunds of premium up to amount those same *aggregated premiums*
- Any benefit received in excess of that amount are subjected to taxes


| Type of Policy – Payor               | Deductible Premiums                                             | Tax Status of Benefits                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual policy – Policyholder     | No                                                              | Tax-free                                                    |
| Group policy – Employer only         | Yes                                                             | Taxable                                                     |

| Group policy – Employer and employee | Portion paid by employer: Yes <br> Portion paid by employee: No | Taxable, with employee premiums reducing the amount taxable |
#### Group policy with individual one - Ind DI can be purchased to cover the benefits gap of GI
- Total benefits should not offset the maximum of 85%
- Insured can **over-insured**, paying for benefits he will never receive 
- Claims are offset from GI and then II 
***
### Creditor Disability insurance - benefits creditors who want to have interest payment in check 
- Creditor Disability is offered with **loan itself**, on optional basis(to avoid tied selling)
- Coverage can be offered with little or not medical underwriting **at the time of underwriting**
- "Total Disability" - inability to earn income due to illness or injury
	- Partial or residual disability will not qualify 
- Benefits are tied to interest payments 

#### Taxation is the same - premiums are personal, non-deductible, expense. OR purpose of loan is to earn income 
- Benefits are tax-free
