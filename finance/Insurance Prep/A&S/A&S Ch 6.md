### Fuck Ups:

### Fact-Finding 

#### Personal Situation of Client:
1. Unique to the client - age, gender, avocation 
2. Martial status - spouse can be an additional source of income  
3. Dependents, if any
4. Client's occupation 
5. Current health 
6. Retirement goals

**Gender** - determines mortality and morbidity(probability of injury) rates

#### Key point is how *long* the insured will need help in case of making a claim
- Women will require benefits for longer +morbidity rate is higher 
- Longevity can reduce premiums for LI but hike-up payment for LTC and DI
#### In case of divorce and dependents, agent should seek a copy of the agreement which describes financial obligation 


#### Agent should assess clients's financial burden and supplementary sources of income
- Martial status
- Dependents 

#### Health history in LI/DI/CI requires work on assessment. Simple "yes" is not enough on report, nature of injury/illness, date of disability, duration, treatment +lingering effect should be described 
- Family health history(parent + siblings) 

***
### Client income - agent has to identify sources of income rather than employment. Investments, trusts, pension plan, etc
- Group policies cover income only from current employee
- If income is commission based - 5 years trend is assessed 
- ##### In case of self-employed, coverage is determined on pre-tax - fixed expenses 

***
#### Sources of income 
1. Investment - dividends, capital gain, interest can be considered as passive income stream. 
	1. In case of registered accounts, such income is reported only upon withdrawing, therefore **not** accounted during assessment 
2. Spouse's - can be considered in case of overall family needs 
3. Investment income can be considered during A&S underwriting **if** funds are being **paid** to the insured and not reinvested 
4. Agent should inquire possibility of client earning income from inherited trusts or estate. How long the payments will be and the annual sum 
5. Government Disability income sources should be explored(CPP, Worker's compensation, EI)
	1. Details can be accessed from policies, group benefits, Service Canada 

#### "Income" defined as: money or other gain periodically received by an individual, corporation, etc.  from investment, employment, property 

***

### Expenses - disability income replacement can be calculated as % of income, usually 60%. Or based on expenses of household 


#### Types of expenses:
1. Living expenses - accommodation, food, light, heat, vehicle maintenance or lease 
	1. Compilation of living expenses conclude the fixed amount a month, after-tax expenses 
	2. Mortgage & rent - change in interest rate and SDV of payments should be accounted 

2. Saving and investment -  
3. Debt 

#### Expenses can be identified by assessing a bank statement 
- Alternatively **net worth and income and expense statement** can filled 
#### To assess client's investment and savings tendency agent can review:
1. Registered investment account - balance, liquidity, maturity dates, surrender fees are in interest  
	1. Non-registered
2. Pension plan
3. LI

#### Review of pension 
1. Commuted value of pension funds on deposit 
2. Portability of funds 
3. Earliest age at which funds can be commenced 
4. Whether it's bridge with CPP or OAS
5. based on current credit pension is paid in regards to age at which pension commence 

#### Cash value of an insurance can also be an income source
1. Annual policy dividends 
2. Cash value loan
3. Premium Holidays (reduction in expense)
4. WP during disability 

#### Debt is interesting for agent because:
1. Monthly service expense 
2. Debt retirement deadline
3. Examples ability to manage cash-flows 


##### HELOC, Credit Card and Tax liability statement - are used in assessment of client's debt and credit history 
- For credit card last three monthly statements should be enough 
- For TL - personal and corporate income tax and GST/HST 
	- Provincial and Federal tax return + Notice of assessment 

#### Other liabilities:
1. Commitments under support agreement (child ex-spouse)
2. Actual or potential lawsuit
3. Support for family members
4. Repayment of Home Buyer Plan 

***
### Financial Position - assess client net worth 

1. Net worth statement - lists all assets and indicates which are in reg accounts, specifies cost basis and then current market valuation 
2. Liability statement - will include items like mortgage, bank loan, credit card unpaid taxes.
	1. Like assets, liabilities are separated into current and long term 

#### Questions to ask
1. In case of disability, does client have enough cashflow to cover income loss for at **least a year**?
2. Medical emergency occurs, does the client have sufficient resources to cover med care and related expenses for **at least a year?**

#### Cashflow statement - more detailed blank for overall analysis of surplus/lack of available cash. Helps to answer questions above 

***
### Government Coverage 
1. EI - formerly known as Unemployment Insurance, provides temporarily fin assistance to terminated workers 
	1. Required to worked at least 600h in previous 52 weeks + suffered income reduction of at least 40% 
	2. in 2024 Ei coverage for sickness was 55% of employee average weekly earning up to 688$
	3. Ei benefit is reduced on dollar by dollar amount by any other disability benefits 
		1. No benefit will be paid if funds were received from other program(except personally owned insurance)
	4. Is a second payee 
2. CPP - contribution plan that pays benefits to "severely injured"
	1. Prevents from working in any capacity

	3. 100% by self-employed
	4. Payed a/month after 120 days of disability 
	5. Benefit terminates if:

		2. Reaches 65

	6. At age 65, benefits are converted into retirement benefit
3. Workers' Compensation - provided on provincially operated plan basis and pays compensation to employee suffers disability due to job duties 
	1. 100% funded by employer as their payroll tax 
	2. 80-90% pre-disability income 

***
### Finalizing
1. Needs base on personal factor 
2. On financial situation 
3. Based on existing coverage 

- Agent must prioritizing **personal needs** 

#### Consideration:
1. Existing coverage is sufficient for client needs
2. There is an unnecessary surplus in client's coverage 
3. Coverage is adequate but there is overlap 
4. There are gaps in coverage
