#### Insured can qualify/claim the benefit if he can't perform ADLs and/or cognitively disabled(can't communicate; has a scatter mind) - retarded  

#### Riders - again:
- COLA - Cost of living adjustment; any annuity program or continuous income replacement has that   
- Return of premiums - can be refunded depending on the time claim-free. 50% for 10 years and 100% for 20 years
	- Refunded benefits are tax-free

#### Policy benefits:
1. Like mentioned before, benefits can be paid to insured or as reimbursement to the service provider(in later case insured must provide receipts to insurer)
2. Benefits can be adjusted by stretching days number 
3. Claiming a benefit is subject to physician medical assessment 

#### Premiums:
1. Have a standard **grace period of 30 days after premiums were not paid**
2. Policy will lapse(void) after that 

3. Premiums are based on:
	1. Coverage provided 
	2. Number of days 
	3. Type of coverage 
	4. Eliminating period 
	5. Underwriting characteristic 
	6. Requirement to qualify for benefits

#### Premiums are personal expense, benefits are tax-free


#### Mixing LTC with other coverage
|Characteristics|Disability Insurance|Critical Illness Insurance|Long-Term Care Insurance|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Event triggering benefits**|Inability to work due to injury or illness resulting in a loss of income|Stroke, heart attack, etc. meeting the definition of covered conditions|Inability to care for oneself independently as defined by the 6 ADLs|
|**Determination of benefits**|Percentage of loss of income due to disability|Benefit paid in a lump sum based on contract coverage|Qualifying expenses incurred by the insured, subject to contractual maximums|
|**Factors determining premiums**|Age, gender, medical history, coverage, waiting and benefit periods|Age, medical history, number of conditions covered, dollar amount of benefit requested|Age, gender, medical history, current health, waiting and benefit periods|
|**Payment of benefits**|Monthly benefit|Lump sum (or set number of periodic payments)|As qualifying expenses are incurred|
#### LTC + DI - no overlap, because DI covers loss of income but *not expenses*
- However some DI can be converted into LTC running until certain age 

#### LTC + CI - tricky, because CI can easily result in LT disability. In general won't overlap

***
#### Limitation of CI and LTC:
- **Contract wording** - definition and degree of disability or illness vary from contract to contract 

"*According to statistics from the Autorité des marchés financiers, over 60% of insurer claim denials stem from limitations or exclusions, pre-existing conditions, failure to meet a definition, and issues related to survival and waiting periods.*"

- Definition evolve over time
