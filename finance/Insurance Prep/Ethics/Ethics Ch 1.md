	- Common law - backed up by court's and judges decision, which are shaped by **previous** decision 
	- 


### LI

#### Agency relationships 
- Agency carries a delegated(entrusted) authority. Agents work for an agency
- ***The principal*** - a person or corporation delegating the authority 
	- The principal controls the extend of the delegation 

#### Insurance company acts as a principal that dictates the rules and controls access of agent's rights within insurance field
- Captive/Independent agent - has access to multiple policy stock, from multiple agencies
	- Place their services through managing general **agents**(MGA), plural form is important, who review applications, submit them to insurers and allocate commissions  
- Career - tied to single agency and/or MGA

#### **Agency** - a corporation or partnership, holding a license from regulator 
- Corporate agency has employees and can have a license for kind of insurance where it has at least 1 employee 
- Agency can submit their business through MGAs

## General Legal Principles  

#### Capacity - despite age and whatever, it refers to ability of providing a "valid consent"
- 18 has the capacity to enter the contract 
- 16 yo has the capacity to refuse connecting with her own personal care
- There is no cap for how old you are

#### Partnerships - can be both individual or corporations that intent to make a profit 
- If not explicitly stated("Limited Liability Partnerships"), all partners carry the liability signed on behalf of partnerships  
	- Common law business, designated for lawyers 

- ##### Legal Person - can be a corporation, entity that separated from those who operate it. 
	- Insurance application often inquire two **"Signing Officers"** 

### Power of Attorney and Enduring PoA 
- legal document made by person who appoints another person, attorney, to deal with the business, legal as well, and property on his behalf. 
- A power of attorney ends if person who gave the power becomes mentally incapable 
- ***Attorney also called and an "agent", one who grants the power is "principal"***
- ##### Enduring PoA - stays in power even if attorney becomes mentally incapable
	- Contract should state it
	- Can come in power immediately or after certain conditions(after medical check)
	- Such attorney can do anything with properties, besides making a "will"
- ##### Insurance agent requires to cross-check the PoA, through "notary public" and review by the insurance company 
	- Insurance agents should refuse to act as clients attorney

##### Guardianship - comes into effect only after person been declared incapable 


### Marriage and Common law Relationship - marriage is a formal, often more automated state between two people. CLR is less formal and more limited; that grants right 
- Marriage - formal legal status that is acquired and terminated according to federal law
	- Marriage is terminated upon death, annulment(invalid since inception) or legally valid divorce(was valid but purposely canceled by someone)
	- Couples can adjust their legal right before or during marriage by entering into a *domestic* or marriage contract / Common Law couples can also enter into domestic contract 

#### During divorce:
- Insurance can be received as inheritance that is not subjected to rebalancing of  financial assets 
- Grounds for divorce are controlled by **Divorce Act**

#### Family Property - property that was acquired or enjoyed by family during the marriage, *or that generates income that supports the family*  
- Division may depend on **when** the property was acquired and **from what source**.  
- Presumed to equal division. Also subjects to a judge's discretion 
- Property acquired before the marriage and/or inherited is safe from division

#### Wills, estate and succession: 
- Succession Law - applies to bodies that handles deceased persons' estate +manages property passing upon death
- **Estate** - collection of property and rights that deceased owned
	- Person can leave a "will" leaving their estate to whoever he wishes 
- Executioner - one who is appointed in charge of estate.
	- Also called "estate trustee"
	- Has the right to pay debt and taxes related to estate and distribute remains according to written will
- ##### Not all property can be managed by will:
	- Property held in "joint tenancy" passed outside of will's terms. Plans with beneficiary names, like RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, pass directly to the character  
	- LI to **named beneficiary** passed outside of will. **in contrast** - LI payable to the estate of policyholder is disposed under the terms of the will 
- Laws strongly protect those whom dead owned legal or moral obligation of support. Fin dependent person(kinds, living spouse)
	- Dependent Relief Legislation - gives compensation under "unjustified" distribution of estate 

##### Those who died with will written, called "testate". Those who didn't called "intestate"
- Estate Administrator / Estate trustee - appointed by court, due to absence of executor
- In case of "intestate" - trustee will distribute the estate according to provincial rules of **intestacy**

- ##### Separation does not influence will - but its a good practice to create a new one after separation 
	- In case of divorce - spouse is treated like legally **dead** 
	- **Will made before marriage is revoked upon marriage**, unless made with marriage in mind

#### Trust and Trustees: 
- Inter-vivos trust - established during life
- Testamentary trust - upon death

##### Unlike guardians - trustee obtain a title upon settlor's property 

- Trustee has a legal obligation to distribute 'em to beneficiaries or according to terms of trust 

- *"Rob gives money to his lawyer, to be used towards Rob’s purchase of a*
*house. The money is put into the lawyer’s trust account, so only he has control*
*over it, and it is in his name. But there is no doubt in anyone’s mind about*
*who the money belongs to, or what it is to be used for. If the lawyer dies, or*
*goes bankrupt, the trust money is unaffected, because it does not belong*
*beneﬁcially to the lawyer.*"

- Insurance proceed are used to create a trust fund or to enhance the size of an existing one. 

#### Bankruptcy - inability to meet debt obligations
- Upon that, Bankruptcy Trustee, collects available assets and befits creditor according to rules of **"Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act"**

##### LI can be used as protection against creditors - *It is not, legally, part of deceased estate, therefore can be inherited bypassing the creditor's payments *
- Named Dependents/Beneficiaries (Spouse, kids, etc) can obtain LI without executors seizure; **IF LI WAS NOT NAME AFTER ESTATE**
- Irrecoverable Beneficiary Designation - 

#### Pension Funds are also exempt from seizure
