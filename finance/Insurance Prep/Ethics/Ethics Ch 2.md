## Insurance Policy Provisions 


### Parties to an Individual Policy 
- LI contracts are entered between parties like:
	- Insurer(Agency and Agents)
	- Policyholder - someone being insured. Individual or legal person(corporation)
		- Insurance is not limited to single holder   
		- Shared co-ownership agreement can indicated terms of holding
- Life Insured - person whose life is insured, and upon whose death benefits are paid
	- For insurance to be **valid at issue,** policyholder must have an interest in the life of the life insured 
	- *Close family, business partners, and anyone whose death will lead to fin consequences*
	- **Beneficiary** - person to whom money are paid 

- #### Insurers will pay benefits to whom is the most recently declared on file 

#### Irrevocable beneficiary - can be changed only upon consent of stated beneficiary
- Consent is also required for withdrawing cash, pledge(collateral) or assign the policy, take policy loans or surrender the policy 
- Beneficiary should not be confused with executor or trustee stated in will

***
Ted owns a policy on the life of his wife Laura, and has named himself as the
beneﬁciary. Ted is the policyholder i.e., the person who entered into the policy
with the insurer. Ted therefore does not qualify as a “beneﬁciary” under the
statutory deﬁnition. He will still receive the insurance money if Laura dies. If
Laura owned the policy on her life, so that she was both the insured, as well as
the life insured, and she named Ted as her beneﬁciary, he would qualify as a
“beneﬁciary” under the legislative deﬁnition

#### Secondary / Contingent Beneficiary 

#### Group Insurance Policies - insurance is being taken on the pool of individuals
- Plan Sponsor - group plans are arranged by him. Employer, union, associate or entity representing the group.
	- Group Insurer / Group Policyholder enters into the master contract/policy with insurer 
- Insurer - does not have a contract with each body of the group. They contract only with the group insurer 
- Member and scope of coverage:
	- In case of employee sponsored plan, **some coverage is mandatory**
	- many plans offer the **optional** increased insurance coverage. Subjected to individual underwriting 
### Formation of Policy 
- Process of forming described in two stages: offer & acceptance 
	- Offer can outstanding for specific time period, can be withdrawn 

#### Unlike standard contracting, in insurance policy is valid and in effect under those rules:
- Application form is complete by the applicant and proposed life insured, with assistance of an agent

- **Temporary Insurance** - issued during underwriting process if policy underwritten answer "no" on 3 out of 4 questions and haven't been hospitalized or ill. It typically goes for 90 days
	- Benefits are subject to temporarily insurance agreement 

#### Change in "insurability" can be a reason for risk reassigning and possible policy decline before the insurer bond itself to liability of the policy 
- Policy does not an effect if insurability was changed 


#### Delivery - policy is not in effect until policy is being delivered to an applicant and first premium is being paid 
- The policy is not in force until all delivery requirement are done and the first premium been paid 
- If premium was not paid and policy applied is COD - the insurance will *not* be in force until payment has been received after the policy has been delivered 

#### Termination - policy can be annulled or cancelled voluntarily by the owner or by *specific* reasons by insurer
- **Rescission** - when a policy is delivered, policyholder has a "10-day lock", i.e time to review and accept/decline the policy or to further negotiate the terms 
	- In technical terms the contract is being withdrawn or rescinded. Premiums are being refunded and policy is dump into the garbage
	- G10 Guideline of CLHIA

#### **Grace period** - is granted for *subsequent* payments, after policy became in force 

- G2 - **2 days lock period for annuity contracts relating to *segregated funds***

#### Surrender - LI is unilateral, therefore policyholder can surrender/terminate it at any time
- If policy has a cash surrender value(CSV), it's paid subsequently to the policy calculation
- Termination can be stated in terms - set number of years after which new coverage should be made 

#### Termination by insurer:
- By fraud, misrepresenting or *intentional* concealment
	- made a misstatement, omit to inform the insurer of a material fact, obtained a policy for which insured does not qualify  
- For non-payment of S&A and LI premiums
	- Can be complicated with CSV involved 

#### Assignment of policy - transfer of ownership of the policy 
- A change in ownership can lead to taxable gains for the assignor 
- Person who becomes a new owner becomes an "absolute assignee" - he has all rights as original policy holder.
	- Withdraw funds
	- Name Beneficiaries 
- **Life insurance can basically be traded**
- Collateral assignment - due to, possibly, substantial CSV besides death benefits, that cash can be used as ***collateral for loan*** 
	- This means, collateral assignment, can be *assigned* the creditor as addition collateral 
	- That, however, restricts the policyholder to do any action that can affect value of security/policy 
	- When loan is paid, the collateral assignee releases their rights to the policy 
	- If Insured **dies**, lender gets just enough benefits to close the loan, everything else goes to beneficiary according to will or terms 
#### Product Specific Provision 

#### Individual LI - many kinds, but all contracts contain basic provision. Required by PIL. Terms and Conditions:

- #### Statutory Conditions - all the requirements and condition should be specified in full when policy is issued 
	- **Reduction** - in some cases policies may contain "customized" provision that affect the offered coverage. 
		- Example: policy may get reduced death benefit if insured lived **longer than expected**
	- **Exclusion** - change to the coverage provided. Death under "some" circumstances would not lead to benefits  
		- **Exclusion imposed by law** - compensation decisions are made by court 
		- **Pre-existing condition exclusion** - exclusion related to pre-existing condition 
		- **Suicide clause** - can be paid if exclusion period(2 years) has passed
		- **Living benefits** - if a person is on a verge of death(usually diagnosed to live for 2 years-ish) some cash can be withdrawn(if any) and benefits paid(partially)
		- CSV - exist in few **permanent insurance** on guaranteed or non-guaranteed basis. Is getting paid if policy is being surrendered/canceled 
			- Amount can be reduced by due payments related to insurance 
		- **Riders** - additional coverage often attached to existing insurance policy. "rider" is the name of the document being attached 
- #### Group Life & Health Insurance - a single insurance policy(master policy) covers specified people who re caller "members/participants" +eligible dependents
	- Has a plan sponsor - policyholder, in legislation called **group insured**. Has a contract with insurer 
	- Members should be clearly defined 
	- #### Types of group insurance:
		- LI
		- Accidental D&D
		- Short term disability and long term disability plans (income replacement)
		- Critical illness coverage
		- Healthcare + dental
		- **Coverage under above plans is constrained by dollar amount** 
	- ASO - administrative services only. 
	- Certificates - when members join the group, their connection to master contract is limited. Insurer gives a certificate to the sponsor(employer), to deliver it to the group member 
	- Booklets - summaries for insurance policies 
		- Section 6 of CLHIA G3, when a group insured person leaves the group he have a **conversion** privilege to convert GI into I insurance policy
			- That right should be exercised within 31 day after termination of membership
	- Access to copy of policy - there is no legislative requirement to provide copy of **master insurance** to members.
		- Some provinces increase availability of MP, allowing members to get copy of **master contract provision** 
	- Members insurance coverage, most often, ends when they lose relation to the group 
#### Individual & Group accidents and sickness insurance 
- #### Accidents D&D - covers defined physical suffering or death due to an accident.
	- Physical loss can include - hearing, sight or limbs
##### Definition of "accident" - is complex and can cause exclusion of benefits. Exclusions:
- Death from sickness(covered by LI)
- Illness 
- Bodily or mental infirmity or decease 
- Suicide or self-inflected injury 
- **War**
- **Riot**
- Involvement of alcohol, drugs, poison or sedatives 
- Commission of criminal offense or assault
- Extreme sports 
- **Certain surgical mishaps** 

**Therefore receiving a death compensation takes time to determine the "accident" of death or injury**
- A&S can provide hospitalization benefits and funds to cover some loss of income and out of pocket expenses **after** the accident

##### Disability specifics - covers full and partial disability or permanent reduction in *ability* to earn income 
- There is opportunity to purchase additional income protection, without medical underwriting 
	- This allow to follow the pace of increasing income of policyholder. Called **Future Income Option**
##### Drug insurance - covers the expensive medication
- Requires to be both policyholder and insured 


##### Clinical Illness - started as cancer insurance, expanded to other serious life threatening illnesses 
- If person diagnosed with covered CI and **survives** for period of usually 30 days, insured gets lump sum of money 

- **Shady area from tax perspective**  - research 

##### Long-term Care (LTC) - insured which requires constant supervision can receive weekly or monthly income replacement(which is not counted as normal Income Benefit but looks similar)
- All disability and LTC insurance plans have a wait period before benefits are payable -> 30, 90, 180 days or longer

##### Provincial Insurance statues also dictate provision related to D&S 


##### No medical underwriting is required for personal accident or AD&D policy *may* be in effect quickly 
- In contrast - illness and sickness requires long assessment of insurability before coverage becomes in force

##### Termination - *the same*, can be willingly surrendered or terminated for not paying premiums after a grace period
- However notice period of 10 days after notice being delivered is also required

#### Annuity - insurer issues a policy to another financial inst. They agree to pay fixed amount to a payee over a specific time period 
- Can be used as investment, fin security, tax planning, estate planning or creditor's protection

- Term annuity - when payments are for defined time period 
- **Only companies authorized to conduct LI business offer life annuities**

- ##### Annuities can deferred or immediate:
	- Related to segregate funds - individual or group annuities. **Deferred**
	- GIA (guaranteed interest account) - I&G annuity. **Deferred**. Resembles Guaranteed Investment Certificate 
	- Immediate annuity contracts
- ##### Parties:
	- Insurer or annuity provider - debtor. Entity that's responsible for pay periodic amounts 
	
	- Policyholder - individual or entity that contracts with insurer.
		
	- **Annuitant** - or life insur**ed**, is a measuring life on which the duration of LA is based. **Not necessary one who receives payments**
		
		- **Payee** - besides natural person it can be a trust or trustee
		- Once payment begun, lump sum is not possible
			- **For all registered contracts "annuitant", policyholder and payee  ==is the same person==**
	
	- Recipient - annuitant guarantee, someone who actually receives annuity payments 
	
	- The designated beneficiary
	
	- Annuities(besides registered plans) - can be owned by individuals, corporations or trusts.
	
	- Annuitant can be classified as "investor" under Income Tax Act 
##### Immediate annuities - payments start with defined and frequent period. 
- **Deferred(accumulated)** - method to avoid taxation now to do that later under lower tax bracket 
- Transfer & Withdraw is generally not permitted if annuitant is still alive 

#### Group annuity - generally employer enters into the contract. Employees contribute to the annuity
- Plan administrator holds an annuity policy for the benefits 
- Group annuity does not fall under definition of insurance, therefore requires less administrative expense 

#### Segregate Funds - individual variable insurance contract(IVIC) is an annuity contract related to segregate funds. -> meaning that premium payments are invested into fund and managed by insurance company 
- Value of policy will depend on value of investments 
- Securities are owned by insurance company 
- Amount of money paid from policy is based on the performance of funds. **The reason why it's called "variable"**
