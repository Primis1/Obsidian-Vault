### Insurance life annuity:
Stephen, age 60, wants to leave his two nieces a legacy of $250,000 each on his death. If he puts aside the $500,000 now, he no longer has the ability to spend that money. Instead, Stephen purchases a term-100 life insurance policy with a $500,000 death benefit. He names his nieces as beneficiaries of the policy. Premiums for the policy are $1,000/month. Stephen then acquires a single life annuity using $200,000 of his savings. He receives about $1,000/month in an annuity payment. He uses the money to pay his life insurance premium. **He has effectively bought an inheritance of $500,000 for the sum of $200,000. He still has access to $300,000 of his savings to use for other purposes, such as retirement.**
