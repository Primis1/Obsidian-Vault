### Fuck Ups:
1. 
***
### Resetting guarantee - can lock the fund performance mark 
- Unique feature for seg contracts
- After reset, the maturity period is delayed, sometimes 

#### EXAMPLE
- An investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund contract. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ($20,000 × 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, and the guarantees are reset, the guarantees will now amount to $37,500 ($50,000 × 75%)

#### Seg funds are purchased in units (20 u by 100$) - the appreciation of those units increases a ACB which then decreases taxes 
1. However **"allocation"** is taxed in marginal rate. Aka seg fund dividend. But unit appreciation is not taxed and can be locked-in by reset

### Redemption (surrender) - is sale of seg units 

### Assuris - compensates 90% of guarantee 
- Deposit $ * 75% * 90%

#### Can be terminated within 2 days after receiving confirmation of recission
