### Fuck Ups:
1. 
***
### Diff of term to permanent LI
1. Can't be renewed past specific age, leaving insured without coverage 
![[Pasted image 20250909225110.png]]\
2. Absence of cash reserves 

#### Types of permanent insurance:
1. Whole life - provides coverage for entire lifetime, with typically level premium. Permanent policy builds-up cash reserves(CSV) which can be acquired under specific circumstances
2. Term-100 - the same as WL but specifically matures at age 100
	1. Typically don't CSV
	2. The same as term insurance, but for 100 years and death benefit is paid at that age(even if alive) or dies early 
	3. Fixed DB 
3. Universal Life - provided for lifetime of insured but doesnt have a **leveled premiums**. Can be used as tax-shelter

***
### Whole life Insurance - doesnt expire nor require renewal 
1. In early years premiums exceed amount of coverage needed 

#### Premiums are based on forward looking mortality rate, expenses and investment return. Insurer uses a *conservative* assumptions to cover the future "underpricement"
- Insurance company understands that it will eventually has to pay death benefit
#### Expense - premiums should also cover operating expenses
1. Cost of selling the policy 
2. Underwriting the policy 
3. Issuing and administrating 
4. Investigating claims 
5. Business overhead costs 
6. Paying death benefits 
7. Dividends to shareholders

**With WL policy all projection should be *far* forward looking**

#### Investment returns - insurer invests money obtained through premiums. Bonds + Low Volatile stocks. Insurance company required to have capital surplus in case of run for death benefit(Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test [LICAT])

#### *Modal Factor? - insurance can charge a lil more depending on frequency of deposits, to compensate for opportunity cost from investment returns 

#### Premium options:
1. Ongoing - fixed premium(traditional) over duration of contract 
2. Single - one lump sum premium that will last for entire duration of contract 
	1. Paid-up policy 
3. Limited payment - requires payment for specific time period, then policy become **paid up**

**Death benefit options:**
1. Guaranteed - offers a death benefit which is *guaranteed*, i.e doesn't change over time 
2. Adjustable - can be changed to reflect **actual experience**, mortality rates, investment return +investment 

***
### Participating policies - contribution to investment strategy of an insurer(then get a dividend)
1. In case of outperformance insurer can issue dividend to participating contracts 
2. Those **dividends** are paid annually on anniversary year of the policy
	1. It works as reduction in premiums or smth 
3. Insured are not punished for shortfalls

#### Non-participating policies - company alone bears the burden of shortfall and surplus 


*** 
### Dividend payment options:
1. Cash 
2. Premium reduction 
3. Accumulation - deposits payment into separate account, can be withdrawn at any time, capital gain and other taxes apply 
	1. Provide options to invest into segregate fund 
	2. All money in accumulation account are paid to estate or beneficiary 
4. Paid-up addition - acquires additional LI policy with its own death benefits and CSV
	1. Death benefit is paid tax-fee
	2. Enables additional coverage, even in insurability condition 
5. Term insurance - can temporal coverage 

***
### Unlike term policy - permanent always provide non-forfeit benefit even after premium payments terminate 
- CSV - amount depends on shortfall vs excess of coverage. In later years when benefit exceed costs, CSV starts to accumulate
	- PUA also goes into CSV
	- **Surrender charges, fees for withdrawing the monies**. Decreases over time
	- Policy loan - up to 90% of CSV, issued by insurance company  
- Automatic Premium Loans (APL) - under substantial CSV, premiums can be covered by automatic loan. Facilitates fin burden for insured 
- Reduced paid-up coverage - uses CSV as single premium payment for limited coverage
- Extended Term insurance - allow to stop PP entirely, while keeping the same coverage in form of **term** insurance

### Using WL isurance - for tax shelter, future insurability +ability to increase coverage over time
