### Evaluate probability, severity and duration of risk 
1. ![[Pasted image 20250915002046.png]]
	1. For each person matrix will be different in regards to circumstances

2. Family health history of genetic or inherited diseases 
3. Lifestyle risk

### Income replacement approach - assess probable income or economic loss in case of death or replacement 
1. To understand the coverage needed we can capitalize income of LI-ed
	1. After tax annual income / rate of return **or after tax rate of return** 
	2. 60000 / 11.5 
2. Accounting for inflation:
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250915211638.png]]
3. Does not account for seasonal needs, use of principal which will deplete the interest income and change in that return

### Insurance needs analysis - understanding the capital *needs*
1. Assess insured income 
2. Determined Ongoing expenses that can:

	5. ![[Pasted image 20250915212244.png]]
	6. ![[Pasted image 20250915212234.png]]
3. Then understand income shortfalls - expense **minus** income  
	1. Factoring in the CPP survivor benefits ($675 monthly for Becky and $265 monthly for each Anya and Robbie), if Derek dies, the family would experience a shortfall of $2,945 per month, calculated as: $2,945 = $4,150 â€“ ($675 + $265 + $265)
4. Capitalize shortfall - using after-tax after-inflation rate 
	1. To determine the temporal short fall = multiply capitalized value by number of years instead of RoR
5. Capital needs:
	1. Final expense 
	2. Tax liability 
	3. Debt elimination 
	4. Estate expenses 
		1. Probate fees

6. Assets available upon death:
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250915223339.png]]
7. Existing insurance - CSV, term, premium, ACB 
8. Shortfall:

### Put it together:
1. Duration of risk - helps to determine if the term or permanent insurance is required 
2. Investment needs
3. Cash flow vs premiums 
4. Dependent and coverage 

***
### Making a recommendation:
1. Type of coverage - term, whole life or UL 
2. Sufficient DB 
3. Premiums 
4. Compare options:
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250915224524.png]]
5. Optimize premiums / make a few tradeoffs 
6. Beneficiary 
	1. to pay taxes - estate 
	2. to have income replacement - spouse 
	3. to help children - trustee until age of majority 
	
	4. Irrevocable beneficiary can used to:
		1. Protect from creditors 
		2. implement charity strategy
		3. Required by court order 
	5. Probate fees - in case of estate as beneficiary, it's subject to **fees**
7. Highlight important clauses:
	1. Exclusions 
		1. Suicide - all policies have two years clause, also after reinstatement 
	2. Incontestability
	3. Grace period 
		1. Reinstatement - if policy lapses most contracts allow to reactivate the policy within 2 years. It has benefits, because policy is based on age of issuing or renewal of lapsed contract 
	4. Right of recission - 10-day lock period
	5. Expiry 
	6. Surrender charges
