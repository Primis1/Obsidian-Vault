### Fuck Ups:
1.

### Term Li - contract between insurance company and insurance applicant to pay a death benefit to a beneficiary if insured within lifespan of contract 
1. Typical term is 1-5 years, 10 or 20 years. Or to specific age (60 yo)
2. Most insurance companies won't provide coverage after certain age (75-80)

***
### Single life - only one person is insured 

#### Joint first-to-die - single amount of coverage is placed on lives of one or two ppl, when one dies benefit is paid to the survivor 
- Terminates upon death of one of the insured 
- Conversion to the same coverage but for personal life is available 
	- Should be exercised within 30 days after death of another 
- Less expensive than two separate 
- **Combined Li is two policies under the same contract, only advantage in shared administrative fees**

##### Joint last to die - paid upon death of *last insured(both must pass away)*
- used for tax protection, when after death of parents for instance estate is transferred to children who then pay capital gain 
- Upon death insurance provide sufficient fund to cover those gains 
- ##### Because of life expectancy, JLTD takes form of universal LI, whole life, permanent LI (until age 100)

***
### Death benefit - Term insurance is purchase for an initial amount of coverage ("face amount"). Death benefit may change over time 
1. Level Term - DB is equal to initial face amount
2. Decreasing term - benefit remains the same **while premium is leveled** 
	1. Initial premiums are generally lower 
	2. Mortgage insurance is kinda a form of decreasing LI, because risk for insurer decreases over time 
3. Increasing - annual or five-year increase, compounded or fixed dollar amount. 
	1. Can be tied CPI
	2. Premiums increase in the same time *by proportional amount*
	3. Restricted by **cap(max benefit amount, 150% of initial value)**
		1. Or cap on amount of increases 

*** 
### Term insurance premiums- every province has a premium tax, in range of 2-5%

#### Set on standard, substandard or preferred basis. Substandard are higher due to risk of insured. preferred basis prs are slightly lower than due to lower than standard risk of insured

- #### Cost of Insurance (COI) - mortality costs, cost for company paying benefit upon death. Estimated by multiplying policy face amount on death probability 

- #### Expenses - cover IC's administrative costs + death benefit 

*** 
### Renewable - guarantee renewal after expiry but with modified conditions 
- More expensive 
- Re-entry - premiums depend on the health of insured, therefore can be decreased 

***
### Convertible - convert term insurance into permanent 
- can be acquired without proof of insurability on the future date 
- Age it which policy is convertible may be restricted 

#### Incontestability + Suicide exclusion clause - converted policy is usually treated as extension of original policy 
1. Two years after the issue for both contestability and suicide periods - **in that time insurance company can void a policy** 
	1. Policy can be voided if any fact that would influence it during issuing would be discovered 
	2. After that period, policy becomes incontestable 
	3. After conversion, insured is **not** subjected to new 2-years contestability period

#### Attained age - age on which premiums are based. Original age - age at which policy was issued 
- Attained-age conversion 
- Original age conversion - tends to have higher premiums to compensate for locked in age 

#### Advantages:
1. Lower initial premiums 
2. Guaranteed premiums over the term 
3. Renewable + convertibility feature applies 
4. Customizable 
5. Defined period of fin commitment 

#### Disadvantages:
1. Premiums and coverage is not guaranteed upon expiry 
2. Expensive premiums the older you get(even more expensive than permanent)
3. Not available past certain age 
4. Worthless at the end (pure insurance)

***
### Usage - Term insurance should be used as temporarily measure for risk protection 
- Suited for short term risk of known duration 
- Risk that diminish over time(mortgage)
- Cheaper, therefore doesn't constrain cash-flow
