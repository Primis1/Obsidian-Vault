### Fuck Ups:
1. **Relevant section(s) of the textbook:** 7.6.3.1 Increasing the face amount
2. **Relevant section(s) of the textbook:** 7.1.4 Adjusted cost basis (ACB)
3. **Relevant section(s) of the textbook:** 7.10 Naming a charity as the beneficiary

### Taxation:

#### Tax-free nature of DB

#### Policy disposition - triggers income tax when *rights(absolute assignment) of over the policy are surrendered or transferred*

#### Adjusted cost basis - some transaction increase ACB, which increase value of principal against possible capital gain 

 
#### Last acquired date
- when policy was last purchased. 
- ownership transferred to current holder 
- coverage under the policy was modified / reinstalled 

#### Groups of policies by taxes
1. G1 - policies acquired before December 2 1982 and that have not been transferred 
2. G2 - after December 2 1982, but before Jan 1 2017, or previous policies of G1 group that lost their status 
3. G3 - issued after December 1 2016, or G2 that lost its status

### Taxation of full surrender - considered a disposition for tax purpose. CSV - Policy loans and liabilities 
- Added into income tax 

***
### Partial surrender - occurs when policyholder reduces his coverage or withdraws funds from an account  


*** 
### Taxation of exempt & non-exempt policies - policy that was acquired prior to Dec 2 1982 (i.e G1 policy) or after(G2, G3) with intent of pure insurance and not to earn investment income

#### Non-Exempt policies are subject to income tax 

#### Exempt policies can be tax-deferred or tax-free


#### Exempt test:
1. Max Tax Actuarial Reserve - projected cash value of investment account of policy(cap on growth which is stated in contract)
	1. If actual value exceeds it in some years the exempt policy fail and therefore becomes non-exempt 
	2. ![[Pasted image 20250913215013.png]]
	3. MTAR is equal to compound value of the account under no-less than 4% compounding 

2. Anti Dump rule - blocks large deposit after 7-th anniversary 
	1. 250% rule, if cash balance vary by more than 250%, **anti-dump provision applies**
	2. For min-funded policies at 2017 relief was granted: removes the cap of 250% if CV was less than 15% of ETP for G2 and 37.5% for G3

3. Nor insured nor agent is responsible for monitoring alignment of account value and MTAR. However Insurer will check it at the policy anniversary and if it exceeds that value => insured is given a 60 days grace period and if nothing changes policy ***becomes non-exempt forever***. To fix it we can:
	1. Increase a face amount (DB) by up to 8% a year, therefore increasing MTAR cap
	2. Partial surrender (withdrawal) which will reduce the account value 
		1. May result in smaller policy gain and keep in mind min withdrawal amount
	3. Side account/fund - automatic transfer of excess cash into separate taxable account 


#### Situations when test can be failed:
1. PUA, because they got vast cash amount relative to coverage 
2. Better investment returns 
3. Extra deposits to participating and main policy

- **Deemed disposition** - taxed as if policy was surrendered

***
### Taxes and replacing existing policy - replacement includes creating a new policy and cancelling old one 
- Therefore it will result in gain to the excess value of CSV over ACB 
- G1 policies are superior to older one(ACB = cumulative premiums - dividend paid) 

*** 
### Absolute assignment - in case of arm-length the tax is not triggered
- Policy gain = CVS - Adjusted Cash Balance. In case of AL transfer ACB is equal to CSV 
- Policy should be transferred directly to the person, not the trust 
- Child should at least 18 yo to make a policy gain taxable in his Tax Rate 

***

### Death of policyholder - policy surrenders and tax is paid in last tax return 
- **Contingent** - someone who receives rights over the policy upon death, bypassing estate 

***
### Taxation strategies:
1. Using the policy as collateral - to take a loan from a third party 
2. Annualizing the CSV - using cash to purchase annuities, basically cancelling the policy and paying taxes 
	1. Is available in partials, in case insured needs some level of coverage
	2. Tax relief is provided in case of disability 
3. Leveraging LI - setting an annual loans with CSV as a collateral and DB as repayment upon death. Similar to Buy-Borrow-Die 
4. Charity giving  - assign LI policy to charity or name it a beneficiary 
	1. Receive Charitable Donation tax credit 
	2. Credit can be received even over premium payments
