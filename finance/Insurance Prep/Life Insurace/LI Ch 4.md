### Fuck Ups:
1. Relevant section(s) of the textbook: 4.1.2 Mortality charges
2. Relevant section(s) of the textbook: 4.6.7 Distribution upon death
	1. Relevant section(s) of the textbook: 4.6.1 Surrendering the policy
3. 4.5.2 Tax deferral

### Universal life polices should be taken like an insurance account, where insurer has much more control over the funds and coverage than in normal policy 
- COI - cost for paying the death benefit. Mortality charge. 
	- Insurer deducts the the COI from policy investment account(therefore charge is always visible to insured)
- Expenses - G&A for insurance company 
	- Thanks to complexity of UL, administrative expenses are higher
- Investments - UL policy is a combination of investment and insurance. Premiums are paid into investment account; it supports deductibles from COI and expenses. 
	- Increasing value of an investments can be used as a tax shelter after insurer's death, and passed to beneficiary without any taxes
- Premiums - 2-4% to the provincial government 

***
### Flexibility:
1. timing and amount - how much premium and when, within limits 
	1. NO modal factors 
2. face amount - existing coverage provided by policy can be extended, however requires a med underwriting at time of request 
	1. Coverage can also be decreased for financial reasons or whatever
3. Life/lives insured - one policy can insure multiple lives. Joint, single or depending on insurance company 

***
### Pricing - how much money insurer draws from investment account 

![[Pasted image 20250911201139.png]]

1. Net amount at Risk (NAAR) - death occurs prematurely, based on mortality rates and then priced into the premiums 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250911201607.png]]
	2. Death benefit can constitute more than the face amount 
	
	3. Pratik owns a UL policy with a death benefit of $500,000 and an account value of $128,000. He has paid $44,780 cumulatively for the COI. The current NAAR of his policy is $455,220, calculated as ($500,000 â€“ $44,780).
2. Yearly renewable term - policy that renews every year 
	1. COI is usually a dollar amount per 1000$ of risk. in UL 1000$ per dollar of NAAR 
3. LCOI - level cost of premiums 

#### Choosing between LCOI and YRT. In early years YRT is cheaper however the longer the term the superior LCOI is 

| Year | YRT ($) | LCOI ($) | YRT Total ($) | LCOI Total ($) |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 1    | 1.13    | 7.44     | 563           | 3,720          |
| 6    | 1.44    | 7.44     | 722           | 3,720          |
| 11   | 1.90    | 7.44     | 952           | 3,720          |
| 16   | 2.83    | 7.44     | 1,413         | 3,720          |
| 21   | 4.31    | 7.44     | 2,156         | 3,720          |
| 26   | 7.25    | 7.44     | 3,625         | 3,720          |
| 31   | 12.81   | 7.44     | 6,406         | 3,720          |
| 36   | 22.60   | 7.44     | 11,301        | 3,720          |
| 41   | 40.96   | 7.44     | 20,481        | 3,720          |
| 46   | 71.11   | 7.44     | 35,556        | 3,720          |
| 50   | 109.04  | 7.44     | 54,521        | 3,720          |

#### Guaranteed vs Adjustable COI
1. Open ended / Restricted policy - posses a significant risk to policyholder, however there are often restrictions to how much it can be increased (25, 50, 100%)

### Death benefit options 
1. Level - be the original value of face amount 
	1. Equal to policy account value if it exceeds the original face amount 
	2. ![[Pasted image 20250911211819.png]]
2. Level death benefit + account value - suitable for who believe that they can manage money in account efficiently 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250911212054.png]]
	2. As a tradeoff the COI is greater than leveled DB
	3. Beneficiary will receive a full net NAAR + account value **tax-free**
3. Level death benefit + cumulative premiums **- account value**  - the most expensive option 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250911212735.png]]
	2. Insurance company keeps the account value if it exceeds the NAAR
4. Indexed Death benefit - DB is increased to the level of CPI

***
### Investment component 
1. Net premiums (Minus COI & Tax) - is invested in will of the insured 
	1. Provides tax shelter for investments 
	2. Excess funds are deposited into separate account, which is taxed annually 
	3. If death benefit includes an account value, growth can be obtained **completely tax free**
2. Daily income account - fixed minimal interest earned 
3. Guaranteed Investment account - fixed ROR, **conservative**
4. Index Fund - og
5. Mutual fund investment - sucks 

#### Interrelationship - if COI increased and not covered by premiums, funds are taken from account 

*** 
### Investment account - also called "accumulated fund", UL provide benefits in case of policy lapsing 
1. Surrender policy - insured entitled to account funds less surrender charges 
	1. Charges apply if insured does it within first 10 years
	2. Surrender charges decrease over time but never exceed account value 
	3. In most case will trigger a taxable capital gain 
2. Policy withdrawals - take funds from policy account, taxable income +insurance set the min amount of withdrawing 
3. Premium offset - paying premiums by investment income 
4. Loans - like whole life policies, UL allow to take a loan against account funds (typically 50-90% of portfolio). 
	1. Can be used to access funds without triggering direct income 
5. Collateral for third-party(fin institutions) loan 
6. Leveraging - margin
