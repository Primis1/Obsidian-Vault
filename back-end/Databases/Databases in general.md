- Real time DB - is a regular database with technologies focused on often changed data, like supabase, firebase or sometimes a BaaS

Relational Databases are called "Relational" because the whole database is based on Relational Algebra that Edgar Codd created. That algebra provides operations like projection and join. Relation here means a set of tuples. You can actually check the book "The relational model for database management" by Codd. If you have a grasp of first order logic and basic set theory, it is a fascinating read.
