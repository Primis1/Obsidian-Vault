Special values:
1. #interfaces - used to specify the behavior of function . They are about doing, not being
	- *With interfaces, if something has the same functionality, it can be reused*
To know:
1. `If function implements `
2. Interfaces improve compatibility, i.e if we set one kind of behavior, aka `toSpeak()`, we can apply it to different object, like `Cats`, `Dogs`, `Human` in this case, they all will implement the same interface 
	- *`So if we gonna make multiple functions, but want to repeat some functionality, we can add typing by using interfaces`*
