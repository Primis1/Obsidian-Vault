Special values:
1. Virtualization - allowing to set a "virtual" something on the computer, that allows to have one server with several OS as example
2. #VPS/VDS - virtual dedicated server, hosting for the web applications. We can rent a virtualized chunk of server with where we are masters and gods  
3. Types of Vt:
	1. OPEN VZ - it can access only for Linux distributives, because it based on a single Linux core, dynamic memory resource usage
	2. KVM - no limits, static resources of the server

To know:

1. Hardware virtualizations - allow a computer to have multiple OS working independently from each other. Basically multiple websites could be hosted on a single machine  

2. Because we launch multiple independent virtual machines, on a the actual? machine, if error occurs in one, it won't affect others 

3. We also can just separate the power of machine into small pieces and sell it to devs, but virtualization allows to launch the actual OS, so it better
