- ### Tell me more about yourself
	1. Well, as you can see from my resume I used to work in many different places. From luxury apparel, to fast-temped environment in Tim Hortons and in direct - or door to door sales. 

	2. Also, I can say that i am on 100% a "people" person - who loves connecting with people in professional environment as well as in casual. I am a book worm who always needs something to read, would it be a financial statement, industry reports, autobiography or other business/customer related material

	3. I don't want to say a cliche about "passion about fashion", however one of my hobbies include modelling, and what I like the most in it, is the fact of meeting professional people who can share their views on the styling and current trends in the industry
	
	4. **And all that brings me here today, and that's why I am exited to learn about this opportunity** 

- ### Why do you like our brand?
	- I’ve always been drawn to Banana Republic because it nails spot I love—**high-quality life-style clothing which's made from people -- to people**. Having worked with luxury, I appreciate how BR started in the 70th as a travel brand and through all these years kept the its nature of constant motion. It’s not just clothes; it’s expensive because of it's quality and impact throughout everything; from store's layout, customer service, especially textile feeling and craftsmanship that feels premium without being stuffy or fancy 
		- Also, I have a warm story when i knew i want to join BR
	- I also have an excitement to work with BR, because it's going to be the first time when I'll work in *publicly traded company*. I study business and industry valuation intensively and how it usually goes: you found a business, you went through financial statements and after you buy and you can't do much after. BR give me a unique opportunity to have an impact. 
		- I will wake each morning knowing that I'm not going just on the work. I going to place where i have partial ownership,  

- ### Why should we hire you?
	- I AM GLAD THAT YOU ASKED! As I understand it, you're looking for someone who... (job requirements):
		- Can connect, engage and therefore provide excellent customer service and maintain high level of floor experience 
		- Meet sales target
		- Who is knowledgeable about styling and keeps track on trends in the industry 
		- Be a team player 
		- Those who can study from failures (failure is not a failure if it is a lesson)
		- And most importantly - be eager for knowledge and disciplined to get  
	- Point-by-point - i believe that i can align with all these requirements:
		- thanks to my experience from selling a premium apparel and footwear, where i learned how to transfer chats into sales. Acknowledgement that that the key is to make someone came here for t-shirt, make him come out with T-shirt and pants
		
		- Secondly, I never forget failures. Failure is not a failure if it's a lesson. If my team and me, haven't met a monthly target on specific product, we should not ignore or forget it, but come together and try to figure our what went wrong so we can improve it next time   
		
		- Lastly my main trait which helps the most outside of work is my hunger to knowledge and growth. I believe in words of Charlie Manger. "Our only mission is to go to bed wiser than when woke up"
		
		- I yet again, believe that those traits can help me pursue success between customers and co-worker  

- ### When did you go above and beyond in customer service?
	- Ohh, it happen during my job in Finland. It was before holiday season and owner just hired seasonal, which were falling behind in trainings. Considering that It was end of second year of work there, i told the manager that i will take responsibility for it. After end of work-day, i would stick around and asking what they don't understand and offering my help. They were my age, what made education/advice process lighter, and made them feel more comfortable. What made them prepared to the customer season 

- ### What is your greatest weakness?
	- It's coming from my strength - when I engaged with customer and already built a strong connection, sometimes It's hard to cut off this established connection, close the sale and move to other customer. You give people and a wonderful time, and they often pay you back with the same thing. 

- ### What makes you standout?
	- My unique drive for improving store operations and self

- ### Tell me about a time you provided excellent customer service
	- Ohh, it usually goes from little chat with a customer and generally, the quality of the service depends on level of connection you can establish. I remember in finland there was a blizzard and customer still came in the store. I started from basics like hayd? Weather is nasty outside right? And word by word i started to understand what is he after. I figured out that he is preparing for spring season and want to have something new for soccer match. We were fans of the same team, therefore we found a common ground from the start and in the end, he came out of the store with not just Oxford T-Shirt, but also a pants, pair of gloves and polo


### How would you sell an outfit to a customer?
- I'd start to build understanding of customer's needs, is it casual or professional. Say, they need something comfy for work. I would suggest a blazer and chinos. Although, I would as well offer a layering. For example an Oxford T-shirt or polo for under the blazer
