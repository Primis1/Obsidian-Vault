- ### Tell me more about yourself
	1. Well, as you can see from my resume I used to work in many different places. From premium apparel, to fast-temped environment in Tim Hortons and in direct - or door to door sales. 

	2. Also, I can say that i am on 100% a "people" person - who loves connecting with people in professional environment as well as in casual. I am a book worm who always needs something to read, would it be a financial statement, industry reports, autobiography or other business/customer related material

	3. I don't want to say a cliche about "passion about fashion", however one of my hobbies include modelling, and what I like the most in it, is the fact of connecting with professionals who can share their views on the styling and going on trends in the industry
	
	4. **And all that brings me here today, and that's why I am exited to learn about this opportunity** 

- ### Why do you like our brand?
	- Steve Madden has a long history of dedication behind the brand. How founder with only thousand and hundred bucks of initial capital investment grew the company to more 2 Billion market capitalization is not ordinary achievement

	- The fact that not a business man, but fashion designer built the company which disrupted the whole footwear industry, **whose believes in trendy, affordable, and edgy footwear, targeting fashion-forward men and women generally remained the same over 3 decades aligns with own believes which i have about fashion industry and with my personal style.**
	
	- The stories about hard rise, then painful sitback and then rise again - are always beautiful 
		- People should be able to wear something that they like and that makes them feel confident 
	
	- **Dolce Vita(sweet life)** was founded in **2001** New York’s. it’s more bohemian and urban

	- I also have an excitement to work with SM or its subsidiaries, because it's going to be the first time when I'll work in *publicly traded company*. I study business and industry valuation intensively and how it usually goes: you found a business, you went through financial statements and after you buy and you can't do much after. BR give me a unique opportunity to have an impact. 
		- I’ll wake up each morning knowing I’m not just going to work—I’m heading to a place where I can feel a sense of ownership, contributing to a brand that’s always evolving, just like the people who wear it.


The Company ended the year with 291 Company-operated brick-and-mortar retail stores and five e-commerce websites, as well as 42 Company-operated concessions in international markets.

- ### Why should we hire you? How do you stand out?
	- I AM GLAD THAT YOU ASKED! As I understand it, you're looking for someone who... (job requirements):
    	- Can connect, engage and therefore provide excellent customer service and maintain high level of floor experience
    	- Meet sales target
    	- Who is knowledgeable about styling and keeps track on trends in the industry
    	- Be a team player
    	- Those who can study from failures (failure is not a failure if it is a lesson)
		- Point-by-point:
			- i believe that i can align with all these requirements:
	    	- thanks to my experience in selling premium apparel and footwear. Acknowledgement that that the key is to make someone came here for t-shirt, make him come out with T-shirt and pants
   	 
	    	- Secondly, I never forget failures. Failure is not a failure if it's a lesson. If my team and me, haven't met a monthly target on specific product, we should not ignore or forget it, but come together and try to figure our what went wrong so we can improve it next time   
   	 
	    	- Lastly my main trait which helps the most outside of work is my hunger to knowledge and growth. I believe in words of Charlie Manger. "Our only mission is to go to bed wiser than when woke up"
   	 
	    	- I yet again, believe that those traits can help me pursue success between customers and co-worker  


- ### When did you go above and beyond in customer service?
	- Ohh, it happen during my job in Finland. It was before holiday season and owner just hired seasonal, which were falling behind in trainings. Considering that It was end of second year of work there, i told the manager that i will take responsibility for it. After end of work-day, i would stick around and asking what they don't understand and offering my help. They were my age, what made education/advice process lighter, and made them feel more convenient. What made them prepared to the customer season 

- ### What is your greatest weakness?
	- It's coming from my strength - when I engaged with customer and already built a strong connection, sometimes It's hard to cut off this established connection, close the sale and move to other customer. You give people and a wonderful time, and they often pay you back with the same thing. 
	- However I can mitigate it by collaborating with my co-workers, optimizing my time during the shift 

- ### Tell me about a time you provided excellent customer service
	- Ohh, it usually goes from little chat with a customer and generally, the quality of the service depends on level of connection you can establish. I remember in Finland there was a blizzard and customer still came in the store. I started from basics like hayd? Weather is nasty outside right? And word by word i started to understand what is he after. I figured out that he is preparing for spring season and want to have something new for soccer match. We were fans of the same team, therefore we found a common ground from the start and in the end, he came out of the store with not just Oxford T-Shirt, but also a pants, pair of gloves and polo

- ### How did you handled  stressful situation?
	- Hmm, I can't remember anything that is too stressful, usually work was just going well, without major issues or problems. However, I remember situations when customer came unsatisfied or rather angry about their tore clothing, hence requesting return. 
	- Sometimes, by company policy we couldn't provide it, therefore I was responsible for facilitating the situation. By company policy i could do nothing, however losing the customer would be a complete waste and harm for reputation. Therefore i asked a manager for "exclusive" discount for that lady. Hence i transferred lose-lose to win-win situation.
	- Obviously we should not give discounts to everyone, but I got a green light from the manager therefore i ran for execution


- ### How would you sell an outfit to a customer?
	- I'd start to build understanding customer's needs, their likes and dislikes by collecting information from them. Say, they need something comfy for work. After determining properties of item, I can suggest something that aligns with sales target . For example an Oxford T-shirt or polo for under the blazer

- ### How would you sell something that they don't like need?
	- Determine what exactly he doesn't like in the product, suggest similar one without that annoying detail. **Also suggesting a target merchandise is preferred** 
	- bundling - **Pair the unwanted item with something they do like or need**
	- Scarcity and urgency can also help - biases like FOMO, urges people to buy something that they don't want it 
	- leverage storytelling - do the research about upcoming trends and suggest and story behind the product. 


- #### STAR approach for open storytelling
	- Situation - context and background, avoid temptation for telling the whole story 
	- Task - what was the problem 	
	- Approach - how did you thought about solving it, improve the issue, 
	- Result -
