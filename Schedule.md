 `People love saying some stock didn't work because of "execution" as some sort of pass-the-buck excuse instead of the real answer: the business sucks and is unworkable for a bunch of structural reasons that we were too foolish to identify in advance

Hi Matt, are you still looking for a room or a place to stay?

I’m also on the hunt, and I was thinking—would you be interested in teaming up to rent something bigger, like a 2 bedroom basement or an apartment?
It’s usually cheaper when you split the rent, and it’s a lot more comfortable than squeezing into a small room in a house or condo 

If you are interested can you share what regions are most convenient for you, so we may search for rents?
