Hypotheses were then developed based on prior literature to address the research questions. In terms of valuation accuracy, these ==hypotheses predicted that value drivers based on forecasted earnings will have lower valuation errors than those based on historical value drivers== (H1a); that value drivers closer to bottom line earnings (Net income) have lower valuation errors than those closer to the Trading Revenue income statement line (H1b); and that value drivers based on earnings excluding Trading Revenue) have lower valuation errors than those based on netcash flow from operations (NCFO) (H1c). In terms of misvaluation, these hypotheses predicted that estimations of P/V ratios using forecasted earnings multiples are closer to P/V ratios based on actual market capitalisation (H2a); that estimations of P/V
ratios based on bottom line earnings (net income) are lower than those based on Trading Revenue, NCFO, BV and EBITDA multiples (H2b); and that estimations of P/V ratios based on Intrinsic Value multiples are lower than those based on earnings or cash flow based multiples. In Chapter 4 the research design used to test the research hypotheses was presented. Using a sample of Australian listed firms comprising 147 acquirers and 129 targets
involved in takeovers announcements from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2005
procedures based on prior multiples-based research were developed. 

Valuation
analysis would be used to investigate how accurate various multiple-based valuation
methods are in valuing firms involved in mergers and acquisitions, as well as to
determine which of the various multiple-based valuation methods are the most
accurate. ==This would be followed by calculating a P/V ratio, where price is estimated==
==using the various value drivers, and Intrinsic Value calculated from a residual income==
==model.== **P/V ratios are then used to ascertain which multiple-based valuation methods**
**are associated with greater misvaluation, with higher P/V ratios suggesting greater**
**over-valuation**.
In Chapter 5, the hypotheses were tested. The major findings were: first, the majority
of computed multiples examined exhibit valuation errors within 30 percent of stock
market values. Second, and consistent with expectations, from a valuation accuracy
point of view the results provide support for the superiority of multiples based on
forecasted earnings in valuing targets and acquirers engaged in takeover transactions.
Although a gradual improvement in estimating stock market values is not entirely
evident when moving down the Income Statement, **historical earnings multiples**
**perform better than multiples based on Trading Revenue or NCFO**. 

==Third, while==
==multiples based on forecasted earnings have the highest valuation accuracy they,==
==along with Trading Revenue multiples for targets, produce the most overvalued==
==valuations for acquirers and targets==.
