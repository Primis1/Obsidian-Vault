Hypotheses were then developed based on prior literature to address the research questions. In terms of valuation accuracy, these hypotheses predicted that value drivers based on forecasted earnings will have lower valuation errors than those based on historical value drivers (H1a); that value drivers closer to bottom line earnings (Net income) have lower valuation errors than those closer to the Trading Revenue income statement line (H1b); and that value drivers based on earnings excluding Trading Revenue) have lower valuation errors than those based on netcash flow from operations (NCFO) (H1c). In terms of misvaluation, these hypotheses predicted that estimations of P/V ratios using forecasted earnings multiples are closer to P/V ratios based on actual market capitalisation (H2a); that estimations of P/V
ratios based on bottom line earnings (net income) are lower than those based on Trading Revenue, NCFO, BV and EBITDA multiples (H2b); and that estimations of P/V ratios based on Intrinsic Value multiples are lower than those based on earnings or cash flow based multiples. In Chapter 4 the research design used to test the research hypotheses was presented. Using a sample of Australian listed firms comprising 147 acquirers and 129 targets
involved in takeovers announcements from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2005
procedures based on prior multiples-based research were developed. Valuation
analysis would be used to investigate how accurate various multiple-based valuation
methods are in valuing firms involved in mergers and acquisitions, as well as to
determine which of the various multiple-based valuation methods are the most
accurate. This would be followed by calculating a P/V ratio, where price is estimated
using the various value drivers, and Intrinsic Value calculated from a residual income
model. P/V ratios are then used to ascertain which multiple-based valuation methods
are associated with greater misvaluation, with higher P/V ratios suggesting greater
over-valuation.
In Chapter 5, the hypotheses were tested. The major findings were: first, the majority
of computed multiples examined exhibit valuation errors within 30 percent of stock
market values. Second, and consistent with expectations, from a valuation accuracy
point of view the results provide support for the superiority of multiples based on
forecasted earnings in valuing targets and acquirers engaged in takeover transactions.
Although a gradual improvement in estimating stock market values is not entirely
evident when moving down the Income Statement, historical earnings multiples
perform better than multiples based on Trading Revenue or NCFO. Third, while
multiples based on forecasted earnings have the highest valuation accuracy they,
along with Trading Revenue multiples for targets, produce the most overvalued
valuations for acquirers and targets. Consistent with predictions, greater
overvaluation is exhibited for multiples based on Trading Revenue for targets, and
NCFO and EBITDA for both acquirers and targets. Finally, as expected, multiples
based Intrinsic Value (along with BV) are associated with the least overvaluation.

These findings are predominantly robust to the alternative conditions examined in the
sensitivity analysis in Chapter 6, namely: increasing of the sample size by removing
the requirement for analysts’ forecasts; reducing the sample size by investigating
acquirers and targets where both meet the requirements to have sufficient
information and comparable firms; and using one, two and three ahead stock market
values as a benchmark for valuation analysis. Nevertheless, three notable insights
from the sensitivity analyses were observed. First, target firms’ valuation accuracy
decreases with the inclusion of firms that are not followed by analyst forecasts
(generally smaller and less profitable firms); Second, the valuation accuracy of an
acquirer multiple diminishes over time when using one, two and three year ahead
market capitalisation as a benchmark. Specifically, the supremacy of forecasted
earnings multiples diminishes significantly when using two year ahead market
capitalisation as a benchmark, with the EBT multiple displaying the same amount of
valuation accuracy. This result suggests the predictive power of forecasted earnings
is most prevalent for current and one year ahead stock market capitalisation.
Similarly, the range of valuation accuracy between the multiples declines as the
benchmark projects into the future. Third, the stock market price at the time of the
takeover announcement has higher valuation accuracy against one, two and three
year ahead market capitalisation than all multiples examined, including forecasted
earnings
