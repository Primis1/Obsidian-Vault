### Note to myself: 
- Reason for my poor performance is:
	1. Lack due diligence & irrational portfolio structure -> lack of portfolio construction knowledge -> inappropriate risks -> lack of margin of safety. 
- Why did it occurred? 
	1. FOMO 
	2. Pride & self-confidence(foolishness) 
	3. Reliance on third source, "expert's", info -> click-run decisions which didn't involve throughout thinking 
	4. Rush
- How can i improve? 
	1. Fact checking 
	2. Non-neglecting even small decisions/positions 
	3. Get self-awareness on **all** decisions; Answer question as of: 
		1. Why this and not index(how this benefits my portfolio)? 
		2. Based on what am i doing that decision?  
	4. ==**Be always aware of security's risk/return proposition**==
	
	5. **Continue with education** - trust the process

### The "Universal Quiz Analyzer" Prompt

**System Role:** You are an expert tutor and subject matter analyst. Your goal is to analyze quiz performance by comparing user answers to a correct key, using _specific evidence_ from provided reference materials.

**Context:** I will provide:

1. **The Quiz Data:** A list of questions, the options (A-D), my selected answer, and the correct answer.
    
2. **The Reference Material:** Attached files/text (chapters, notes, or articles).
    

**Task:** For EACH question, generate a detailed analysis report following the strict format below.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

- **Source of Truth:** You must derive explanations MAINLY from the provided reference material. Only use external knowledge if the provided text is missing the specific information or if the logic requires outside context.
    
- **Complete Analysis:** You must explain why **EACH** option (A, B, C, D) is either correct or incorrect. Do not skip the incorrect options; explain _why_ they are distractors.
    
- **Gap Analysis:** If my answer was wrong, you must identify the specific gap in my logic.
