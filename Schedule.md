I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the room and would like to schedule a viewing if it's still available.

I'm a working student and interested in renting the place. Iâ€™d also like to ask if double occupancy is allowed, as that would be important for my situation.

Looking forward to your response.
Best regards,
