- [ ] BYD unit economics 
	- [ ] Okay, it's so big that i got lost +plus my addiction stood in the way. Bottom Up approach -> What it sells? Cars, Equipment, Other(Write it down) -> Where it sells? (assign weights) -> Who is the competitor there? (in niche producer, specific sub-segment would be enough, but BYD sells cars of all calibers; compare product functionality) -> who is end consumer? (does company do the right thing to connect ) how sticky & price sensitive they are? -> what is their current market share and how much they and industry in those regions can grow? -> are they expanding into other segments (repeat all previous questions +will they have an edge thanks to their core business)
	- [ ] Among them you can discover competitive advantages & economies of scale

#### Why?

1. I want to complete my valuation model based on needs/issues i encounter with "straight-forward" business 
2. I want to diversify into less correlated(with IT and broad S&P) sector
3. I want to practice writing financial reports & submit new application into vic + substack 
4. I will invest only after upcoming report & potential upside of over 30-40%  
5. Apply knowledge from SA & CS

### Note to myself: 
- Reason for my poor performance is:
	1. Lack due diligence & irrational portfolio structure -> lack of portfolio construction knowledge -> inappropriate risks -> lack of margin of safety. 
- Why did it occurred? 
	1. FOMO 
	2. Pride & self-confidence(foolishness) 
	3. Reliance on third source, "expert's", info -> click-run decisions which didn't involve throughout thinking 
	4. Rush
- How can i improve? 
	1. Fact checking 
	2. Prudency even in small decisions/positions 
	3. Get self-awareness on **all** decisions; Answer question as of: 
		1. Why this and not index(how this benefits my portfolio)? 
		2. Based on what am i doing that decision?  
	4. ==**Be always aware of security's risk/return proposition**==
	
	5. **Continue with education** - trust the process
