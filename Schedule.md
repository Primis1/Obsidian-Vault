To-do:

- [ ] WeBull research:
	- [x] Pin-point valuation metrics(assets & users )
	- [ ] Peer Comparison (Robinhood)
	- [x] Excess return approach + dcf 
		- [x] Estimate price target 
	- [ ] Top-Bottom q3. 
	- [ ] Compare to KSPI report 


#### Critique:
1. I want to change SCHG into QQQ, and sooner or later build position with SPY instead of SCHD 
 -> SCHG is even heavier in IT sector, i want to diversify my portfolio on about 10%, however i don't want to be SPY only, because i still believe that there are enough room to grow for FAANG 
 -> as a hedge or safer measure i choose regular spy, SCHD holds too many unfavorable businesses

### Note to myself: 
- Reason for my poor performance is:
	1. Lack due diligence & irrational portfolio structure -> lack of portfolio construction knowledge -> inappropriate risks -> lack of margin of safety. 
- Why did it occurred? 
	1. FOMO 
	2. Pride & self-confidence(foolishness) 
	3. Reliance on third source, "expert's", info -> click-run decisions which didn't involve throughout thinking 
	4. Rush
- How can i improve? 
	1. Fact checking 
	2. Prudency even in small decisions/positions 
	3. Get self-awareness on **all** decisions; Answer question as of: 
		1. Why this and not index(how this benefits my portfolio)? 
		2. Based on what am i doing that decision?  
	4. ==**Be always aware of security's risk/return proposition**==
	
	5. **Continue with education** - trust the process
