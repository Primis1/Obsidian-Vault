I don't know how long I can last and struggle *just* with hatred, it fuels me well from time to time and generally i am honestly disgusted by ppl, however the less care the less feel the anger for the unfairness and less I have the ballistic power in pursing anything I need. "*HATE HATE HATE HATE*" - in my head gives me less and less, at least that what i think in moments of prosperity. *I need to find something else, I already know what, but i think i am not strong enough for it*. Maybe like Nietzsche said "*Give some hatred for enemies of yours*". Ubermench is not fueled by hatred or envies, but by share willpower towards his values
