I don't know how long I can last and struggle *just* with hatred, it fuels me well from time to time and generally i am honestly disgusted by ppl, however the less care the less feel the anger for the unfairness and less I have the ballistic power in pursing anything I need. "*HATE HATE HATE HATE*" - in my head gives me less and less, at least that what i think in moments of prosperity. *I need to find something else, I already know what, but i think i am not strong enough for it*. Maybe like Nietzsche said "*Give some hatred for enemies of yours*". Ubermench is not fueled by hatred or envies, but by share willpower towards his values

if PE is a reflection of ROIC, G and RR. What happens during better than anticipated Q-report with the same guided ROIC, G and RR? 

What happens: good Q-1, higher revenue, lower PE(because denominator became bigger)? But market will price-in that better quarter and P/E should stay the same(market rose up the share price, bigger nominator). But considering that projections stayed the same from time before Q-1, will P/E rise, drop or fall after that one positive Q-report in more than a year?
