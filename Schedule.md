To-do:

## MY LIFE PLAN(in construction):
- [ ] #### Have a reasons to wake up no matter the age. Have values which i want to sustain. Goals to pursue 
	- [ ] Have a craft-goal to achieve, where i can work with worthy people|
		- [ ] Be intelligent / extraordinary. To attract worth liking people = i should be worth liking 
		- [ ] If i love someone, why should i be a parasite or burden? Will i be satisfied with myself? Will deserve it? 
			- [ ] You should give to get back, if people are *those people* everyone will be giving and getting even more 
	- [ ] Have a person i want to make happy, and who is interested in me and consider *me* important 
		- [ ] If the world is pointless and dark, your existence is important for you and you alone, nothing you can do about it, you can't cherish yourself double as much and thus it's importance in one's life is unique and singular. 
	- [ ] Able to do activities which i like with those who i love 
		- [ ] I need to have resources(wealth = power) 
		- [ ] Be able to make those people happy 
		- [ ] Have access to pleasures and able to share 'em 
			- [ ] I need productivity and opportunities 
			- [ ] I need to extract maximum ability from body 

- ## **Have `the` WILL & thus POWER to follow and accomplish above**

#### Life which is worth living should contain: someone special, surrounded by those who like and love, be able to do what interesting things/complex things that you like *with* people you like AND don't confuse *real* values with just imitation, fakes and hollows
