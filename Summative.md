Hello, I’m J. For my critique, I will be analyzing Gary Ross’ _The Hunger Games_ using a feminist lens followed by a Marxist lens. Directed by Gary Ross and released in 2012, _The Hunger Games_ is an adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ novel of the same name (IMDb). It is a dystopian film set in Panem, where a domineering authoritarian capital terrorizes its citizens by separating them into twelve districts and forcing them into grotesque annual games for their entertainment. The film follows Katniss Everdeen, a girl from the lowest district who volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her sister.

A feminist critique analyzes the representation of women in literature and advocates for women's rights by broadening the comprehension of women’s experiences and asserting their worth (Gillespie CD107). Applying the feminist lens to _The Hunger Games_ reveals a pro-feminist film. It distinguishes itself through its depiction of a resilient female protagonist who not only explores fundamental feminist ideas of women’s worth and capability but also boldly challenges typical gender stereotypes.

_The Hunger Games_ proves to be a pro-feminist film through its resilient female protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. Consistently throughout the film, Katniss rebels against the constructs of the Capitol and demonstrates agency by exhibiting attributes traditionally expected in men, like leadership and physical strength. This is evident when Katniss attains the highest training score out of the 24 tributes (Ross) and when she refuses to kill her district-mate, Peeta, instead leading them as martyrs against the Capitol, asserting to Peeta, “why should they [have their victor]?” By highlighting her agency and calculated rebellion, the film reinforces Katniss as a resilient protagonist, underscoring the movie as pro-feminist.

Alongside Katniss’ resilience as a protagonist, the movie’s exploration of fundamental feminist ideas further advances it as a pro-feminist film. The film builds on a central idea of feminism: women's worth and capability. Katniss demonstrates characteristics that directly contrast those of a typical young heroine. She is not “greatly worried” about whether “guy number one” likes her and what “guy number two” might think about that (Pollitt). Rather, she is a self-sufficient powerhouse who continuously exhibits profound aptitude. She embodies this idea when she courageously retrieves medicine for a severely injured Peeta, even after he declares that she “is not going alone” (Ross). Additionally, she saves Peeta from eating poisonous berries. These instances of self-sufficiency and competence amplify her worth as an individual, further establishing the film as pro-feminist.

Finally, the movie boldly challenges the stereotype that a woman's sole purpose is to seek romantic love and validation (Loobeek 13). Instead, the film focuses on Katniss’ familial dedication and individual purpose. Notably, Katniss provides for her family, hunting small game after her father’s death, and volunteers for the games in place of her sister. Furthermore, when faced with critical survival decisions, Katniss consistently strategizes for her survival. By having Katniss fill the role of protector and provider, the film challenges traditional gender roles, solidifying it as a pro-feminist film.

Overall, applying the feminist lens to _The Hunger Games_ reveals a pro-feminist film. It distinguishes itself through its depiction of a resilient female protagonist who explores feminist ideas of women’s worth and capability while challenging typical gender stereotypes.

A Marxist critique analyzes literary works to understand how they reflect class differences, “economic or otherwise,” alongside the impediments and implications of capitalism (Purdue OWL). Applying the Marxist lens to _The Hunger Games_ reveals an anti-capitalist film. It depicts a failing society marked by income disparity, crazed consumerism among the elite 1%, and authoritative government control. However, the film ultimately fails as an anti-capitalist work.

The movie portrays stark income disparity. Early in the story, the twelve districts are introduced, with Katniss coming from the poorest of them, District Twelve, where citizens resort to extreme measures to survive. For example, Gale has his name put into the Reaping forty-two times to provide for his family (Ross). The disparity is emphasized when Peeta burns bread to give it to a starving Katniss. These instances critique capitalism's failure to ensure social equity, reinforcing the film’s anti-capitalist stance.

The portrayal of consumerism among the elite further supports the anti-capitalist theme. Upon arriving at the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are swarmed by opulent citizens in bizarre outfits. The Hunger Games themselves become a spectacle, with Capitol citizens engaging in intensive gambling and providing aid to their favorite tributes. This extravagance juxtaposes the lower districts’ poverty, critiquing the excesses of capitalism.

Finally, the Capitol’s authoritarian control critiques the oppressive structures of capitalism. Peacekeepers enforce rules suppressing individual liberties, with citizens condemned to forced labor and prison-style housing. Violence is a key tool of control, as seen in the harsh punishments for rebellion and the enforcement of production quotas to accumulate wealth. These depictions underscore the destructiveness of authoritarian capitalism.

In conclusion, _The Hunger Games_ succeeds in presenting anti-capitalist critiques through its depiction of income disparity, consumerism, and authoritarian control. However, its ultimate failure lies in profiting from a capitalist system, grossing $638 million over 12 years (citation needed). When viewed through both lenses, _The Hunger Games_ emerges as a pro-feminist film while simultaneously critiquing capitalist structures.
