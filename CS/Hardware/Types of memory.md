Special values:
1. RAM - random access memory, fast, we capable of reading and writing into that memory, it is also temporal/depending from electricity
	1. SDR - single data rate RAM, 
	2. DDR2,3,4 - Double data rate RAM, faster and fresher
	3. SRAM - static RAM, it is faster than DRAM, but more expensive 

2. ROM - read only memory, incredibly fast *==reading==*, electricity independent, 
	1. PROM - program ROM
	2. EPROM - Erasable PROM, can be rewritten by unplugging the EPROM from the computer and manipulating with ultraviolet 
	3. EEPROM - Electricity EPROM, can be rewritten by program, but writing is slow

3. #cache - memory - just *fast* memory, used as #buffer between processor & RAM, processor seek the data in cache first of all, if empty it seeks in the RAM, used for often *used* programs 
	1. l1,l2,l3,l4 - *==than higher, that better==* 

4. VRAM - memory designed for work with graphic, yep this one is for GPU, the Witcher, Dark Souls, video-editing, etc.
