Special values:
1. Big-O - checks the effectivity  of algorithm in the worst case
2. Big-Ω - checks the effectivity  of algorithm in the best case
3. Big-Θ - checks the effectivity  of algorithm in the average case

To know:
1. O(1) - Constant - Amazing, doesn't matter of how many elements are there, it'll always take 1 opecation 
2. O(log n) - logarithmic complexity - Good
3. O(n) - linear - Fair, the amount of operations growth by one through each element of the array
4. O(n^2) - quadratic - Terrible, each time it takes in 2x times more operations on one new element 
5. O(2^n) - exponential -  Terrible, amount of operations growth exponentially for each element
