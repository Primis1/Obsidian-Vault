### Special values:
1. #D/BFS  - Depth/Breath First Search, algos used for traversal/search algorithms in Tree/Graph data-structures 
	2. Uses #queues 
	3. Checks all nodes on the same `story`

### To know:

#### Concepts:
- ##### BFS  
	1. In traverses level by level, it explores all children of node, before going to next level 

	- ##### Process:
		1. Start from the root
		2. Visit all immediate neighbors of the root 
		3. Move to next level 
		4. Repeat
```go 

```


- ##### DFS 
	1. Explores Tree/Graph as deep as possible on a single branch 

	- ##### Process:
		1. Start at the root 
		2. Visit next and next node till the end 
		3. Backtrack to last unvisited node, and go deep again
