[[Data Structures]]
Special values:
1. Heap - is based on a #binary-tree *like* data structure, that satisfies tree concept. The value of each ==node== is ==greater== or ==equal== to its ==children==. Values could ==increase== or ==decrease==   
	1. min #heap - Root node contains the ==minimum== value  
	2. max #heap - Root node contains the ==maximum== value

To know:
1. Heap operations
	1. Insert - ==adds== new elements to the heap 
	2. Extract Min/Max - removes the ==minimum== or ==maximum== and returns it 
	3. Heapify - convert a arbitrary #binary-tree into the heap 

2. Heap usage:
	1. Priority #queue implementation. Elements are retrieved by its importance/priority/value 
	2. Heapsort. Sorting algorithm sorts an array in Min/Max order 
	3. Graphs Algorithms. 

Implementation:
```ts
