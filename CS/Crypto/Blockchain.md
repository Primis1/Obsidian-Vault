### Special values:
1. #blockchain - distributed and immutable ledger of nodes, each of which contains transactions, 
	- asset - all that appears on the internet can be stored within the blockchain
### To know:

##### *Blockchain is a public database distributed across blockchain-network peers* 

#### Concepts:

- #blockchain-network - infrastructure of participants, who maintain the blockchain 

#### Key elements:
-  Distributed ledger of technology:
	1. All participants across #blockchain-network has access to its immutable record of transactions
	2. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the replicas 

- Immutable records:
	1. No participants can change the temper the transaction after it was recorded to `ledger`
	2. If transaction contains an error, new transaction must be added to reverse an error 

- ==Smart Contracts==:
	1. Set of rules which is stored on the #blockchain / #blockchain-network and run automatically.
	2. It enforces and executes pre-defined rules and conditions, ==without need for intermediaries== 

#### How it works:
1. Create a block for data 
2. Create operation which will put data to the block
3. Hash the data, can use any encryption algorithm, like SHA-256
4. Tide nodes together, in immutable order
