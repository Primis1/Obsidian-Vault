#### Special values:
Factors:
1. Code base - `one codebase tracked in VMS, can have many deploys 
`
2. Dependencies - `explicitly declared and isolated dependencies`  

3. Config -  `Store config in environment, that not lead to leaks of credentials`. is everything that can vary between deploys(==developer environment, staging, production==)
`
4. Backing services - `Tread backing services as attached resources`.(резервне копіювання) is any service the app consumes as part of its normal operations. 
`
5. Build, release, run - `strict separation of build, release and run stages`. Because of its separation we can not modify the code at the running stage as example

6. Process - `execute the app as one or more stateless processes`. Processes are stateless and share nothing 

7. Port binding - 

8. Concurrency - 

9. Disposability - 

10. Dev/prod parity 

11. Logs - 

12. Admin process - 

#### To know:

##### Concepts:

- ##### Code base: 
	- There always ==one-to-one== relation between `app` and `codebase`. If there are multiple `codebases`, it is not an app - it is distributed system  

	- There is single `codebase` per `app`

- ##### Dependencies:
	-  Twelve factor app ==never== relies only on ==explicit existence== of "somewhere on the system" dependencies. We ==declare== our ==dependencies== and exactly, via a `dependency declaration manifest`   

	- Furthermore we ==isolate== our dependencies, so during execution "==leak-in==" is not possible
	
	- `dependency declaration` and `isolation` - should both be included in the project. Only `declaration` or only `isolation` is not sufficient to satisfy #twelve-factor  
	
	- #twelve-factor dependencies are also not relying on system specific commands like `curl`  

- ##### Config: 
	- `Config` should be separated from the `code`
	
	- Config stores: Resource handles to the DB, Backing services; Credentials to external services(like Twitter); Pre-`deploy` values, such as the canonical hostname for the deployment  
	
	- If app can be made as open source at any moment, and we did not compromise any credentials. `Config ` was successfully factored

	- The data of config should be hidden, a good way to do so is to store it in something like `config.yml`, and ignore it by version control 
- ##### Backing services:
	
	- They include `datastores`,  `messaging queries`, `SMTP` services, `caching` services
	
	- Application's code should not modified(besides `config`) after change from local utility to third party one. From local `MySQL` to `Amazon Storage`,  from local `SMTP` to third party `SMTP` 
	
	- Administrator can attach and detach the *resources* by his with

- ##### Build, release, run:
	- Build: 
		- It is a stage which converts the code repo into the executable
	- Release:
		- It takes the executable and combines it with current `config`
		- every release should have it's own, unique ID
		- Releases are immutable after its creation
	- Run:
		- run the app in the environment
