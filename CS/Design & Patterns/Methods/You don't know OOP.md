### Special values:
1. blog post about true meaning of OOP 

### To know:

### Jots:
- ##### What is `object`:
	- an abstract term which extrapolates that "object can be anything"  with the state, and behavior attached to it

- ##### A bit of SOLID:
	- Rules of `Barbara Liskov` - children should not change the behavior of it's parent, i.e children can be used everywhere its parent can be used  

#### Problems:
1. ==Encapsulation==: often poorly restricted, lead to too much external access to the object 
2. ==Inheritance==: tightly ties object, making code more fragile
	1. ==Composition==: alternative for ==inheritance==, combining smaller object, to create functionality for larger one
3. ==Polymorphism==: often overcomplicated; should be used to create flexible interfaces, and nothing more
4. ==Abstraction==: often, developers expose or complicate usage of an objects
