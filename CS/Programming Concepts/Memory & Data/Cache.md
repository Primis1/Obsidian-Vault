[[Memory & Data]]
###  Special values:
1. #cache - is an alternative data storage of the main memory. It stores frequently requested data somewhere, where the speed of its accessing should be faster and more efficient

### To know:

- ==Cache is characteristics:==

1. Cache in computers acts like a #buffer between CPU. CPU checks the data in faster cache memory, and only after goes into the main memory(RAM)
	1. If processor finds that the memory location is in cache, a *==Cache== ==Hint==*  occurred and data is read from the cache 
	2. If processor !finds the data location in cache, a ==cache== ==miss== has occurred  
2. Cache is costlier than main memory or disk memory, but more economical than CPU registers
