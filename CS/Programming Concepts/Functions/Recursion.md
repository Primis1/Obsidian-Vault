Special values:
1. #recursion - is a function that calla itself. This technique is ==not== used for performance, but for readability and over all shorter syntax
	1. ==base==-==case== - the case of function that doesn't use any recursions, i.e a termination case 
	2. ==recursive==-==relations/steps== - a recursive set of rules that narrows all other cases into the ==base==-==case== 
To know:
1. The way to think:
	1. 
2. When we implement a recursion, we basically create another ==copy== ==of== ==the== ==function== but ==NOT== calling the function itself, it allows to create a loop of nested functions  
3. Many algorithms use recursion
