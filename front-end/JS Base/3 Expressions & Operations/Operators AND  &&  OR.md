Special values: 
```ts
true && true   //=> and 

flase || true  //=> or 
```

To know:
1. &&  -  Works in the way that, two values should be equal true, and wont render the value on the right side if the value on the left is false
2. | |     -  Returns the left value immediately if it's value equal - *true*, and doesn't render the right side of an expression. It will return the right side if the left is *falseness*
