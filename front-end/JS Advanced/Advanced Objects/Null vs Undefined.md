***
### Special values:
- Both null and undefined show the absences of value

### Diff:
- `undefined`
1. Variable was declared but was initialized, i.e value was not assigned 

- `null` 
1. Strongly shows that was is absent, it says that variable should contain an object, but right now it is void 
2. It is an object, and not a data-type
