Special values: 
1. Revalidation - it's a purging of cached data, for receiving a new one. 
	1. Useful for situations when data changes, therefore i want to ensure that i show the fresh one 
2. #cache - in nextJS fetched/returned data caches itself in the *data cache* on a server, by default
	1. Exceptions: if fetch uses inside of *SA* or *Route Handler* that use POST 
3. Static/Dynamic render - if the segment of route is static(default), it will cache the data, but its dynamic the output will not be cached. 

To know:
1. Cached data has *two* ways of revalidation 
	1. Time based revalidation - revalidate the data after the specific amount of time, useful when changes in data aren't critical.
	2. On-demand revalidation - manually revalidate data on a specific event(server actions, forms), 

2. Time based revalidation:
	```ts
	fetch('http//bla-bla', {next: {revalidate: 3600}})
```
	1. On-demand revalidation - could be used in SA or Root handlers. Thus data could be revalidates two ways: by path of the url( *revalidatePath* ) or by cache tag( *revalidateTag* )  

3. Caching and behavior of third-party libraries that could not support or expose fetch( database/ORM clients/queries/CMS ), could be configured by:
	1. `cache`  - react function. For what've seen so far, we just have to cover the async function into the cache( ), and it will be memorized.
	```ts
import {cache} from "react"

export const getNote = cache( async (id: string) => {
	const note = await dbCLient.note.findMany({
		where: {id: id}
	})
return note 
})
```
	3. React Segment Config Option - got no clue
