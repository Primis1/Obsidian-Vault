[[Types Chapter]]
Special objects:

1. Those who returns false:
	“”
	0
	-0
	Null
	Undefined 
	NaN

To know:

1. All other types are true

2. Don't need to overcomplicate the stuff like 
		`if(o !== undefiend) {bla bla bla} 
		simply `if(o) {bla bla bla}`
		because it is true by default
	
3. "!" does return true, if the operant is false. (you need to practice to fully    
	acknowledge it man...)
