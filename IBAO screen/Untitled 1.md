8.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we will cover the background, guiding principles, and operational structure of how liability insurance works in Canada and, specifically, Ontario. But let’s start with a brief history lesson.

8.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF BRITISH AND FRENCH SETTLEMENT IN CANADA

Image

Canada officially became a country in 1867 with the signing of the British North America Act —but our history, and the relationship between the French and the English, goes back even further. It is that history that has shaped the legal systems in Canada.

Much of North America, from the Maritimes to the St. Lawrence River valley in eastern Canada to large swaths of American land along the Mississippi River, was colonized by France starting in the 16th century. (Great Britain, through the Hudson’s Bay Company, controlled the northern lands draining into Hudson Bay.) French control of the colonies from afar led to a very tumultuous existence. nevertheless, French laws and customs were ingrained in the residents along the St. Lawrence.20

When the British defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City in 1759, they gained control over the whole country. The Quebec Act 1774 gave certain rights to the French in the newly English controlled Canada. The French inhabitants were allowed certain controls over their own religion, education, and laws. Canada eventually split into Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec) in 1791.

8.2.1 Civil Code and Common Law Systems

Though French colonialism had ended by the early 1800s, many generations of French Canadians had settled in Canada by that time. The French influence in Lower Canada resulted in the use of the civil law, as was used in France. The English ruling governors decided to leave these areas of Canada under local governance and law. Finally, in 1866, Quebec’s civil laws were codified under the Civil Code of Lower Canada.21 (This was replaced by the Civil Code of Quebec in 1994.)

Meanwhile, in Upper Canada and the Maritime provinces, the controlling influence was the British Parliament and the Church of England. As a result, British common law was established in the rest of Canada. Quebec prospered under its Civil Code, while the rest of the country developed under common law, and these two legal systems have endured to the present day. (However, criminal disputes and federal matters are governed by the common law system.)

Quebec’s Civil Code is a body of law containing a series of articles, which comprise all matters that might give rise to a dispute. When a court settles a dispute under the Civil Code, the appropriate article is selected, and a decision is made based on it. Theoretically, the court does not need to follow the decision made in a similar case, but in practice, the court does consider the interpretation of the same article made by earlier courts.

In contrast, common law judges are required to give written reasons for their decisions, and these reasons become part of the public record of the law (also known as “case law” or “precedent”). Precedents often vary from one area to another, so ultimately courts have to decide which precedent is the most appropriate for any given situation. Case law is a dynamic system and is constantly evolving.

In civil matters, under both common law and Civil Code, a judgment is rendered based on a previous decision, whether written in the Civil Code or in a prior common law decision. Both systems are flexible enough to deal with how our society is evolving.

8.3 LEGAL CATEGORIES

Civilized societies need codified laws to function properly. The more evolving and complex a society, the more complex the system to deal with disputes. Laws are created to govern society and the interaction of people. Without rules, we might find ourselves in total chaos in our daily activities. When these rules are violated, those responsible must account for their actions.

In Canada, we have two categories of law to govern society: criminal law and civil law. Let’s explore these in greater detail.

8.3.1 Criminal Law

Criminal law deals with wrongs against society. It relies on a system of punishment as a means of enforcing its many rules, which are defined in the Criminal Code. Violators are prosecuted in the criminal courts by a prosecuting counsel. The penalties for violation of society’s laws are generally fines, penalties, imprisonment, or probation.

Examples of criminal wrongs include:

• Murder.

• Manslaughter.

• Burglary, robbery, and theft.

• Possession and trafficking of drugs.

Criminal law seeks to determine guilt, which means it is rarely concerned with compensating the victim of a criminal act for the wrong they suffered. All provinces and territories are subject to the same laws regarding criminal wrongs.

Notably, insurance companies do not insure the financial consequences arising out of criminal acts caused by the insured. Therefore, we will not be discussing criminal law further in this textbook.

8.3.2 Civil Law

Civil law is concerned with settling disputes between individuals or other legal entities that do not involve a criminal act. When a dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation between the parties, it can proceed to a civil court, which will provide a ruling in accordance with the legal principles involved. It provides a judicial forum to assign fault by interpreting and developing common law principles and applying the relevant statute law.

The courts will become involved only when the plaintiff (the party complaining) initiates the action against the defendant (the party alleged to have committed the wrong). The goal in any civil action is to seek compensation for the financial loss or damage suffered by the wronged party. For our purposes, we will be discussing civil law under the common law system only.

In common law, the current court decision must follow previous decisions made in cases having similar circumstances — this is known as the rule of precedent. The idea underlying common law is to develop, through successive judicial decisions, a logical body of general principles that can be used to compare specific cases. Relying on legal precedent ensures that justice is dispensed in an even-handed and consistent fashion. However, circumstances change and a precedent established many years ago may no longer be considered legally, socially, or equitably valid. Sometimes, a precedent is overturned and a new one is established.

Government statutes can also impose civil liability. Statutes are written laws derived from bills introduced into Parliament and provincial legislative assemblies to deal with specific needs. When passed, these laws take priority over any existing common law dealing with the same matter. While the breach of certain statutes (such as the Criminal Code) constitutes a criminal act, many statutes are concerned only with clarification for matters of civil liability. For example, the purpose of the Occupiers’ Liability Act enacted in many provinces is to define the responsibilities of occupiers for the condition and use of their premises.

Within civil law, there are two branches: contract law and tort law.

8.3.2.1 Contract Law

As we’ve learned, a contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties. It is a private bargain, and the terms are intended to express the intentions of those parties.

Parties to a contract enter into obligations. These obligations are not set out by law; rather, they serve to reflect the parties’ private intent. In a contract law dispute, the civil court requires parties of the contract to show that they fulfilled their obligations.

As we discuss liability insurance, we will not be dealing with contract law. Instead, we’ll focus our attention on tort law.

8.3.2.2 Tort Law

A tort is a wrong done to another in breach of a duty laid down by law. It is defined as “a wrongful act which has negligently caused damage or injury to another. This wrongful act may be an intentional act, a negligent act or a failure to act.”22 Importantly, a tort is not a breach of a contract.

The principles of common law make people responsible to their neighbours and to others for certain acts resulting in injury to them or damage to their property. For example, the operator of an automobile is responsible in law to anyone who might be injured through its negligent operation. A person who commits a wrong is known as a tort-feasor. When two or more parties act together to cause injury or damage, they are called joint tort-feasors.

Many torts or private wrongs are remedied in civil court, such as:

• Trespass.

• Nuisance.

• Defamation (libel and slander).

• Negligence.

8.3.2.2.1 Elements of a Tort

There are three elements required in every tort action. If any one element is missing, no tort or wrong has occurred.

1) Legal duty owed: This element presupposes that one party has the right not to be harmed unreasonably and the other party has a duty to refrain from causing harm. This must be a non-contractual right, otherwise it would place the situation within the area of contract law. The defendant (the tort-feasor) owed the plaintiff (the injured party) a legal duty.

2) That duty is breached: There must be a violation of the right to be free from harm or a breach of the duty not to harm. The court will attempt to determine if there was a breach of that legal duty owed to the plaintiff.

3) Damages were suffered as a proximate result of the defendant’s (tort-feasor’s) action: There must be some injury or damage caused to the person having the right to be free from harm. The proximate cause rule states there is a chain of events uninterrupted, without the introduction of another primary cause, from the initial act to its conclusion.23

For example:

Tomomi slipped on ice in a shopping mall parking lot and broke her ankle. While attempting to reach the mall to receive first aid, she was struck by a vehicle, sustaining further damage. If the court rules against the mall, the only damages they will be required to pay will relate to the broken ankle. The subsequent damages would relate to the car accident.

Note: Beyond our discussion of the elements of torts, there is a concept of Concurrent Causation, which means that at times there may be concurrent causes which act together to cause injury or damage which would not have resulted in the absence of either. Concurrent causation involves two distinct causes, operating simultaneously, to produce a given result.

An example of concurrent causation is if strong winds from a hurricane damage a house structure, then a sudden blast of wind blows open the front door and allows heavy rain water to flood the entrance.

8.3.2.2.2 Classification of Torts

Torts can be broken down into two major classes: intentional torts and unintentional torts.

1) Intentional torts require:

• The actual intent to invade the rights of the victim. For example, a battery or a physical attack upon a person is an intentional tort against a person’s freedom from bodily injury.

• An intentional undertaking that would reasonably be expected to result in injury or damage.

Payment for damage intentionally caused is excluded from liability policies.

2) Unintentional torts require:

• A careless, rather than intentional, invasion of another’s rights. When injury or damage results, the person wronged is entitled to sue for damages.

This carelessness, or negligence, in unintentional torts is addressed by the tort of negligence. Negligence is the most common tort, and it is the most important tort in the study of liability insurance.

8.3.2.2.2.1 Negligence

Black’s Law Dictionary defines negligence as “the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those ordinary considerations which ordinarily regulate human affairs, would do, or the doing of something which a reasonable and prudent man would not do.”24

The law does not demand perfection to be the standard by which a negligent act is judged. It only asks what a “reasonable” person would do — that is, the standard adopted in the community by persons of ordinary intelligence and prudence.25 Failing to act in this reasonable manner can constitute a negligent action.

A person is negligent only if the results of the act, or failure to act, could have reasonably been expected or foreseen — that is, if they knew or should have known that their conduct involved an unreasonable risk of harm. Lighting a fire outside on a windy day with a fire ban in place would constitute an expected unreasonable risk.26

8.3.2.2.2.1.1 Onus of Proof

The law generally holds individuals innocent until proven guilty. This is true in criminal law, but it also applies to civil law cases involving negligence, where the responsibility for proving the case falls upon the plaintiff.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. In the following situations, the onus of proof falls on the defendant:

• Statute law: Statutes created by provincial and federal governments may impose strict liability. The provincial Highway Traffic Acts (concerning vehicular accidents involving pedestrians) normally assume the defendant is guilty unless proven innocent.

• Res ipsa loquitur (“The thing speaks for itself”): If a car parked next to a building being spray painted is covered in paint at the end of the day, the painters would have to prove they did not cause the damage.

• Absolute liability: Certain activities have been determined by legislation or common law to create liability without regard to fault. These are normally activities in which harm to others would result if a mishap occurred. The person undertaking the activity should understand the potential dangers, and it is reasonable to hold that person strictly accountable if someone is harmed. Examples of absolute liability include keeping a dangerous or wild animal, storing or transporting excessive amounts of flammables or noxious substances in a populated area, or allowing the spread of an intentionally set fire (see Section 9.3.8.3.6: Absolute Liability). Absolute liability is also known as strict liability.

Even though these situations shift the onus of proof to the defendant, there are conditions that absolve this shifting of the burden:

• A force majeure, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or flood.

• The plaintiff’s own actions created the situation to arise.

• The activity was a deliberate action by the third party (or plaintiff).

• The plaintiff consented to the activity giving rise to the damages.

Unless the activity is expressly excluded, liability insurance policies generally respond to pay for injuries or damages arising out of activities that the insureds might be held strictly liable for.

8.4 LIABILITY

8.4.1 Liability Coverage Flow Chart

We’ve covered a lot so far, so let’s step back and look at how a liability policy will provide coverage for an act that broke the law. Follow the arrows to determine whether an action is covered under a policy’s liability coverage.

8.4.2 Insurers’ Responsibility for Damages

A legal action usually results in great financial hardship to those involved. In a civil suit, where the goal of the action is to seek compensation for the amount of the injury or damage, a judgment against the insured could result in a considerable loss of wealth. Generally, the amount of the monetary award provided by the courts is referred to as “damages.”

Insurance companies are prepared to assume the financial responsibility of others when they fail to comply with certain of society’s laws. The following are general guidelines:

• Criminal acts caused by insureds are not insurable. There is no policy that agrees to pay fines or penalties assessed by the court for injury or damages caused by an insured’s criminal activity.

• Civil liabilities are insurable. In these cases, insurance companies will assume the financial responsibilities not only of individuals, but of other legal entities — such as associations, corporations, and governments — for their torts. As we learned earlier, there are many types of torts, but the most important is the tort of negligence.

Note: The information provided here regarding torts, negligence, and liability is of a general nature. It is up to qualified legal practitioners and the various courts — not insurance brokers — to determine the outcome of matters of tort and negligence.

However, because of the legal nature of liability, insurance brokers must have a basic understanding of the law. This knowledge will help brokers identify their client’s liability exposure and recommend the appropriate protection. In order to do that, brokers need to be aware of a few important precedents that will give rise to liability exposures.

8.4.3 Important Precedents

8.4.3.1 Persons on the Premises

Under common law, when persons are injured, their rights depend upon the circumstance under which they came to be on the premises. There are established categories of duty for the occupier or owner of that property. The standard of duty of care required to be exercised by the occupier will not necessarily be the same for all persons entering the property.

There are several categories for persons entering premises:

• Trespasser: A trespasser is a person who is on another person’s premises for their own purposes without the express or implied permission of the occupier. Their presence is of no value to the occupier and such a person is viewed as having temporarily appropriated the property for their own use. The law places no legal duty on the occupier of the premises for the safety of the trespasser, except they cannot set traps or intentionally cause harm to the trespasser.

• Visitor (applicable to Ontario): The Occupiers’ Liability Act has amended the common law terms of “licensee” and “invitee,” classifying them within the heading of “visitor.” A visitor is anyone who enters the premises other than a trespasser. Occupiers must ensure that all visitors are reasonably safe in using the premises.

• Children: In common law, the accepted legal position is that children lack the mature judgment needed to avoid risk and therefore need to be protected. Certain property, such as construction sites, attract children by their very nature. This is often referred to as an “attractive nuisance” or an “allurement.”

8.4.3.2 Persons Outside the Premises

• Neighbours and passers-by: Neighbours and passers-by can sustain injury or damage as a result of the condition of the occupier’s premises or the activities conducted inside. If property is used in a normal manner, occupiers are expected to maintain their buildings and land to avoid the escape of water, sewage, or other obnoxious matter to the detriment of neighbours. Occupiers who bring dangerous items onto their property and allow them to escape could be held strictly liable for damage or injury to others.

8.4.3.3 Domestic Animals

A large number of claims for injury or damage caused by domestic animals deal with dogs and, in particular, dog bites to innocent third parties. In 1981, an Ontario court ruling held there is no first free bite, and a dog’s owner is deemed legally liable from the first bite. In some municipalities, certain dog breeds have been deemed dangerous, and this has impacted the rating on some liability insurance policies. Zoos and other parties that keep wild animals shall be held strictly liable for injury or damage inflicted by that animal either on or off premises.

8.4.3.4 Children

The activities of children have been the source of numerous bodily injury and property damage claims. Children playing with matches have been responsible for losses to vacant properties, schools, and other buildings. Their careless use of firearms and motorized recreational vehicles has also resulted in permanent injury and death to playmates, friends, and others. In common law, children are responsible for the bodily injury and property damage they cause, unless it can be proven in the courts they were incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions.

Children are responsible for their own torts. Parents are not generally required to pay for the torts of their children, unless it can be shown there was a:

• Failure to properly supervise and control their child’s activities.

• The injury or damage was caused by a dangerous thing or animal relinquished by the parent to the control of the child.

• The injury or damage was caused by a child acting on the authority of the parent.

• The injury or damage arose out of the duties of employment in the parent’s business.

8.4.3.5 Landlords

In common law, landlords are not responsible for ensuring that a building or land rented to others is fit for the purpose for which it is rented, unless they specifically warrant the fitness for such purpose or conceal any adverse conditions.

Exceptions to this are:

• When a landlord rents furnished premises to a tenant, it is presumed that the premises are fit for the purpose leased at the outset of the tenancy.

• If the landlord has contracted to maintain the premises and fails, after reasonable notice to do so, any injury or damage to property of the tenants is the responsibility of the landlord. In buildings having multiple tenancies, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the condition of the areas common to all tenants, including roof, stairways, parking areas, and lobbies.

8.4.3.6 Tenants to Landlord

A business which operates out of rented premises faces the potential for liability for loss or damage to the building. The tenant’s responsibility for such loss may be addressed in:

• Tort law: If a tenant is liable in tort for damage caused, the building owner is entitled to compensation. For example, when damage arises out of the tenant’s negligence, the tenant will be liable to the landlord for damages.

• Contract law: In most instances, the extent of a tenant’s liability for loss will be stated in a contract, such as a rental or lease agreement with the building owner.

8.4.3.7 Bailees

A bailee for hire is someone who has the temporary custody of the personal belonging of another for a purpose other than the sale of that item and who is compensated for caring, servicing, or fixing such property. For example, dry cleaners, garages, trucking companies, and delivery firms are all bailees. There is a potential for loss to the property in the bailee’s possession. Under tort law, bailees are required to exercise the same care over the property as would be exercised by others in the same business. They become responsible if that ordinary care is breached by their negligence. Under contract law, that duty of care is assumed under a separate contract.

8.4.3.8 Employers to Employees

In common law, employers are be held liable for the torts of their employees during their employment. This is known as “vicarious liability,” where one party has the indirect legal responsibility for the acts of another.

However, there is an exception when the employee acts outside the scope of their duties. In these situations, there is no liability when an employee delegates any or all of their work without the employer’s consent, when they take time off from their duties to attend to personal matters, or when they use the employer’s property for their own use and cause damage.

8.4.3.9 Independent Contractors

People who hire contractors to do work on their premises will generally be named in a legal action if the work being performed results in injury or damage to others. The status of the person doing the work determines the extent of the owner’s liability when injury or damage results from that work. Generally, occupiers of property are not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor if it can be shown that reasonable care was exercised in the selection of the independent contractor and it was reasonable that the work the independent contractor was engaged to do should have been undertaken. The exceptions are when the work was inherently dangerous; the independent contractor was using defective fixtures, machinery, or equipment supplied by the occupier; or the occupier controlled the manner in which the work was to be done.

8.4.3.10 Joint Liability

Injury or damage may not always result from the actions of a single person. When two or more persons act negligently to cause injury or damage to others, they are called “joint tort-feasors,” meaning that they are jointly liable. The onus placed on persons working together is the same as if they were working alone. Reasonable care must be taken to ensure that injury or damage does not result out of their actions.

When there are two or more tort-feasors, disputes concerning the apportionment of damages could take a long time to resolve and may involve a separate legal action between the tort-feasors themselves. To ensure that the plaintiffs receive the damages awarded to them as soon as possible, the law provides that when equal liability is disputed, each tort-feasor will be held liable for the entire amount of the award. In order that the plaintiff does not receive twice the amount due, the tort-feasors’ insurers would be prompted to each pay 50% of the damages and settle their own concerns between themselves or, if required, through the courts.

8.5 THE INSURING AGREEMENT

As you’ve learned, the insurance process involves an analysis of the risks presented by the insured. In the past few chapters, we’ve discussed some of the risks presented by the ownership of property and the actions of the insureds. It is important to identify and determine which risks can appropriately be transferred to the insurance company and which may not be covered due to the risk presented. There may also be exclusions under the policy wording. In those cases, the insured may have to self-insure.

A liability policy generally deals with specific activities and is not designed to insure all exposures faced by insureds. Generally, a separate policy will be required for each of the insured’s personal, business, professional, and automobile liabilities.

Most insurance companies include liability coverages in their habitational policies. This eliminates the need for homeowners, condominium unit owners, or tenants to purchase a separate policy for their liability exposure. This is Section II: Liability Coverages in the Homeowner Policy Booklet. Automobile liability is part of the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1) and is mandatory (we’ll cover the OAP 1 in detail in Chapter 9: Automobile Insurance). Commercial policies treat liability as a separate policy form, as most policies need to be tailored to the risks presented by the business (we’ll explore this in Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance).

Insuring agreements transfer these risks to the insurance company. The agreement sets out the relationship between the insured and the insurer. There are common features to all insurance policies, be they automobile, personal property, or business liability. For example, the main insuring agreement on most liability policies can be summarized as follows:

“The insurer agrees to pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay to third parties as compensatory payment for bodily injury or property damage. It must be caused by an occurrence; it must occur during the policy period, and it must take place in the coverage territory.”

Additionally, it is important to understand each of the seven underlined parts of the agreement. Let’s explore them in detail.

8.5.1 Pay All Sums Legally Obligated to Pay

It is up to the courts to determine the legal obligation of the insured either in tort or contract as to their obligation to a third party. Though an insured may feel they have a moral obligation to make a payment to an injured third party, the policy will only respond when the insured is responsible. Negligence must be established.

8.5.2 To Third Parties

The coverage provided by liability policies is described as third-party coverage. While property insurance policies provide payment directly to the owner of the property lost or damaged, liability policies indemnify the insured for payments to others for which the insured is legally liable. Black’s Law Dictionary defines a third party as “one who is not a party to the agreement or to a transaction but who may have rights therein.”27 If an insured were to slip and injure themselves on their own property, they could not make claim on their own policy.

8.5.3 For Compensatory Damages

There are three types of damages classified as compensatory. Each is meant to compensate for the injury or damage caused by the defendant to the plaintiff. The compensation will be assessed in terms of money.

1) General damages: These are subject to interpretation and are for such items as pain and suffering, loss of limbs, damage to reputation, or mental anguish. It reflects the amount the court believes necessary to compensate the aggrieved party fairly.

2) Special damages: These are quantifiable and can be accurately measured. They are specific to medical, rehabilitation, and other like damages.

3) Nominal damages: These are for personal injuries, such as libel and slander.

Punitive or exemplary damages are not covered. These are damages intended to punish a defendant for their actions and serve to deter others from similar behaviour in the future. Payments for these damages are borne by the insured themselves.

8.5.4 For Bodily Injury and Property Damage

The definition of “bodily injury” is very broad. It refers to physical injury sustained and associated with external causes. It includes not only physical injury (such as a slip and fall at a residence) but sickness, disease, and death. It can also include personal injury, such as being detained by a store detective on suspicion of shoplifting, or slander or libel.

Damage to property includes the loss of use of that property. When a person’s negligent act causes physical damage to property, the actual costs to repair or replace that property — including additional expenses incurred in continuing to live or do business at another location — can be claimed from that party.

8.5.5 Caused by an Occurrence

An occurrence is defined as an event that occurs suddenly and unexpectedly which can be fixed in time, or that occurs over a long period of time. The first part of the definition is straightforward, while the second part refers to “the continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions” — for example, repeated exposure to coal dust or asbestos resulting in lung disease such as cancer.

8.5.6 During the Policy Period

The insurer will respond to claims occurring during the period the policy was in force.

8.5.7 Within the Coverage Territory

In personal lines insurance, the coverage applies worldwide; on a commercial policy, there may be geographical restrictions, such as within Canada or the United States and its territories. When dealing with commercial risks, the broker must ascertain a company’s trading area to ensure the proper coverage.

8.6 SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS

The limit of insurance provided by the policy for bodily injury and property damage is reserved for the payment of claims. However, there are additional expenses incurred by both the insurers and insured in investigating, settling, and defending a claim. These expenses are provided under a separate insuring agreement known as “supplementary payments.” These are included in all of the liability policies we will be studying and follow from the insuring agreement.

Supplementary payments are extremely important for all insureds. They are usually not limited to any specific amount and, with most policies, they are provided in addition to other coverage limits.

8.7 THE COMPREHENSIVE HOMEOWNER, TENANT, CONDOMINIUM UNIT OWNER PACKAGE POLICY

For this discussion of personal liability, we are using the Comprehensive Homeowner, Tenant, Condominium Unit Owner Package Policy. This section will give you a general overview of the coverages, limits, and exclusions applicable to this policy form.

Whereas the automobile policy, OAP 1, is governed by statute law and is the same for everyone, this is not the case for property policies. In addition, each insurance company will have their own policy form. As we learned in Chapter 7: Property Insurance, brokers must be aware of these differences and provide the most appropriate policy with the best coverages for their client.

Most insurance companies include the liability coverages in the property policy, which means there is no need for the insured to purchase a separate policy. This liability coverage is the same for all three policy forms and is shown under Section II: Liability Coverages. There is one liability coverage exclusive to condominium unit owners, but otherwise, we need to learn only the one form and apply it to all three policy forms.

The liability coverages under the Homeowner Policy are as follows:

• Coverage E: Personal Liability.

• Coverage F: Voluntary Medical Payments.

• Coverage G: Voluntary Payment for Damage to Property.

• Coverage H: Voluntary Compensation for Residence Employees.

• Coverage I: Loss Assessment (applicable to condominium unit owners only).

The limit of insurance for each of the five coverages is indicated on the coverage summary page. Insurers set their own minimum limits for each of the coverages, and insureds cannot buy less than that amount. For example, most insurers provide the following limits:
Coverage 	Amount
Coverage E: Personal Liability 	$1,000,000
Coverage F: Voluntary Medical Payment 	$5,000
Coverage G: Voluntary Payment for Damage to Property 	$1,000
Coverage H: Voluntary Compensation 	As per the Schedule
Coverage I: Loss Assessment (applicable to condominium unit owners only) 	250% of Coverage A1

Coverage E: Personal Liability can be increased for an additional fee. The other coverages usually remain at the limit shown on the policy. These coverages are not normally subject to a deductible; however, an insured with a history of claims may have a deductible applied as an underwriting criterion for continuing coverage.

Every policy has its own set of definitions and exclusions particular to that policy. Because of the nature of liability insurance, some of the definitions from Section I: Property Coverages need to be expanded and clarified. There are exclusions specific to liability insurance, as the policy is not meant to provide coverage for every situation an insured may find themselves in. Refer to pages 15 to 24 of the Homeowner Policy Booklet for the actual wordings.

8.7.1 Key Definitions

The following are key definitions for the liability policies:

• Person insured: The persons shown as insureds under Section I: Property Coverages are also insured under this section. However, coverage is extended to include the following:

- Any person or organization legally liable for damages caused by a watercraft or animal owned by the insured and to which this insurance applies. This does not include anyone using or having custody of the watercraft or animal in the course of any business or without the owner’s permission. For example, a person caring for a neighbour’s dog or a friend driving the boat at the cottage would be covered. A professional dog walker or a marina operator in the course of their business would not be covered.

- A residence employee while performing duties in connection with the ownership, use, or operation of motorized vehicles or trailers for which coverage is provided by this form. Motorized vehicles include such items as lawn mowers, garden tractors and their trailers, and snow blowers.

- The insured’s legal representative having temporary custody of the insured premises, if the insured dies while insured by this form, for legal liability arising out of the premises. Liability arising out of the maintenance or use of the insured’s property is covered. The executor of the estate is automatically covered.

- Any person who is insured by this form at the time of the insured’s death and who continues residing on the insured’s premises.

• Premises insured: Section I: Property Coverages defines “premises,” in the case of a homeowner, as the dwelling and the land contained within the lot lines on which the dwelling is situated. In the case of the condominium unit owner or tenant, this means the dwelling or unit, including garages, outbuildings, and private approaches reserved for their use or occupancy only.

However, Section II: Liability Coverages broadens this definition to include other locations, including all premises where the insured maintains a residence, including seasonal or other residences, provided such premises are specifically described on the coverage summary page.

It also includes:

• Premises where the insured is residing temporarily or which the insured is using temporarily, as long as they are not the owner of the premises or the lessee or tenant of the premises under any agreement which is longer than 180 consecutive days.

• Premises in Canada to be occupied by the insured as their principal residence, from the date they acquire ownership or take possession but not beyond the earliest of:

60 consecutive days.

- The date the policy expires or is terminated.

- The date upon which specific liability insurance is arranged for such premises.

• Individual or family cemetery plots or burial vaults.

• Vacant land in Canada the insured owns or rents, other than farmland.

• Land in Canada where an independent contractor is building a one-, two- or three-family residence to be occupied by the insured.

8.7.2 Coverage E: Personal Liability

Personal liability coverage is designed to insure the legal liability of insureds in their role as private citizens while anywhere in the world. Accidental injury or damage caused by insureds — for example, while on holidays; at public meetings; or while shopping, fishing, golfing or playing ball — are included within the kinds of private wrongs insured by this insuring agreement.

Coverage is provided for injury or damage arising out of the ownership, use, or occupancy of all premises insured by this section. The condition of the insured’s premises and the activities conducted on them are major sources of liability claims.

Examples of losses covered by the policy include:

• Drowning of a neighbour’s child in the insured’s swimming pool or hot tub.

• Injury to a passer-by caused by the insured’s dog.

• Guest injured when the railing on the back deck collapsed and the guest fell.

Claims for injury or death sustained by a residence employee are also covered. Currently, there is no requirement to enroll these employees in the provincial workers’ compensation plan. As the population ages, there will probably be a greater number of residence employees engaged in households. These employees are entitled to compensation from the insured when they can show that the insured was legally liable for their injuries. This employer’s liability exposure is insured by this policy.

We have noted that every policy has exclusions, as no policy can be so broad as to cover every situation. Under Coverage E: Personal Liability, the following exclusions apply:

• Liability that the insured has assumed by contract, unless the insured’s legal liability would have applied even if no contract had been in force. However, insurance companies do insure claims made against the insured for the legal liability of other persons in relation to the insured’s premises that have been assumed under a written contract. In other words, the insured cannot voluntarily assume the liability of others and expect their insurer to pay for the injury or damage caused by such persons. And there are exceptions to this rule, as well: for example, when the insured would have been liable anyway or when the liability being assumed is related to the insured’s premises.

• Damage to property owned by an insured. This will be insured under Section I: Property Coverages of the policy.

• Damage to property used, occupied, leased, or rented by or in the care, custody, or control of an insured, except for the unintentional property damage to premises owned by others, or their contents which the insured is using, renting, or has in their custody or control caused by fire, explosion, water damage, or smoke. Courts recognize and enforce payment for harm done to property of others. Coverage is provided for unintentional property damage. This is called tenant’s legal liability. In personal insurance, this is included in the policy under Section E: Personal Liability; in commercial insurance, it must be purchased specifically. In the context above, “smoke” means due to a sudden, unusual, and faulty operation of any heating or cooking unit in or on the premises, but not smoke from a fireplace. Water damage has the same meaning as under Section I: Property Coverages.

• Damage to personal property or fixtures as a result of work done on them by the insured or anyone on their behalf.

• Bodily injury to the insured or to any person residing in their household other than a residence employee.

• The personal actions of a named insured who does not reside on the premises as described on the coverage summary page.

8.7.2.1 Defence, Settlement, Supplementary Payments

Under all liability policies, the insurer agrees to pay all costs associated with the defence and settlement of claims (including the following supplemental payments), even if the claim made against the insured is groundless or without merit. The insurer agrees to investigate, negotiate, and settle any claim they decide is appropriate and will only pay for the legal counsel of the insured that the insurer selects. For example, if the investigation conducted by the insurer leads it to believe the plaintiff would be successful in a legal action against the insured, the insurer may offer to settle the claim out of court. This right exists even though the insured might claim they are not responsible for the injury or damage.

The limit of insurance purchased by the insured and shown under Section E: Personal Liability is reserved for the payment of the judgment against them and cannot be used for any other purposes. The amount provided by this additional insuring agreement is over and above that limit.

The costs insured by this agreement include:

• Cost of defence. The actual legal costs to conduct a defence in a complicated action can total thousands of dollars. This agreement covers those expenses.

• Reasonable expenses incurred by the insured at the insurer’s request to assist in the investigation and defence of the claim, including all bonds as required by the court.

• Court costs assessed against the insured. The court may rule that the insured bears all the costs of both the plaintiff and the defendant.

• Interest from the date the judgment was rendered, but only on the amount which is within the limit of insurance provided by the policy.

• Expenses which the insured has incurred for the emergency medical or surgical treatment to others following an accident or occurrence insured by this form.

• The reasonable expenses — including actual loss of income up to $100 per day — which the insured incurs at the insurer’s request.

8.7.2.2 Obligations of Insureds after an Accident or Occurrence

When an accident or occurrence takes place, the insured must promptly give the insurer notice (in writing, if requested by the insurer). The notice must include the date, time, place, and circumstances of the accident or occurrence. It must also include the names and addresses of witnesses and potential claimants. Prompt notification allows the insurer to quickly assess the potential for a successful action against the insured. If the insurer believes it necessary, a written report may be required.

This prompt action ensures that the facts of the incident are fresh in everyone’s mind. An inspection of the accident site may reveal facts which might remove or reduce the responsibility for the loss from the insured. It is also important for the insurer to be allowed to interview witnesses as soon as possible to ensure that important details are not forgotten.

The insured must co-operate with the insurer in any legal action, including obtaining witnesses, information, and evidence about the accident or occurrence if the insurer asks the insured. The insured must also immediately send to the insurer legal documents and any other written communication they receive concerning the accident or occurrence. The insured must co-operate fully with the insurer in the preparation of the defence.

It is extremely important that copies of any demands, notices, summonses, or legal papers be forwarded immediately. These documents could allow the insurer to file an objection to the claim with the court.

The insured must not make any unauthorized payments except at their own cost, nor should they assume any obligation or incur expenses other than first aid expenses necessary at the time of the accident. The right to defend and settle rests with the insurer. Any payments an insured may make are an infringement of that right and are prohibited.

Though this is a general description of what to do after an accident, each of the following coverages has its own specific explanation of what to do after an accident or occurrence and should be consulted for clarification.

8.7.3 Coverage F: Voluntary Medical Payments

This insuring agreement provides for the payment of reasonable medical expenses when an insured unintentionally injures another person or if they are accidentally injured while on the insured’s premises. The types of claims for which payment will be made include surgical, dental, hospital, nursing, ambulance service, and funeral expenses.

The insurer agrees to voluntarily make such payment on the insured’s behalf. In other words, there is no requirement that the insured be legally liable for the injury before payment will be made. The payment is limited to the amount shown on the policy and is limited to one year from the date of the accident. Payments are not made when the injured person is covered by a provincial workers’ compensation plan, a hospitalization plan, or other private insurance plan. These payments are provided without regards to fault.

8.7.4 Coverage G: Voluntary Payment for Damage to Property

The insurer agrees to make a voluntary payment for property damage which has been unintentionally caused and for which the insured would not be legally liable. It will also reimburse others for the direct property damage caused intentionally by an insured 12 years of age or under.

It does not provide coverage for damage to property the insured or their tenants own or rent, damage to property insured under Section I: Property Coverages, or claims resulting from the loss of use, disappearance, or theft of the property.

8.7.5 Coverage H: Voluntary Compensation for Residence Employees

Coverage E: Personal Liability provides coverage for the insured’s legal liability for injury or death to a residence employee. However, when such employee is injured or killed through no fault of the insured, there is no coverage. Coverage H is designed to provide residence employees with limited benefits in such situations. (The Homeowner Policy Booklet contains a schedule of benefits).

These benefits include payment for:

• Loss of life, including funeral expenses.

• Temporary total disability.

• Permanent total disability.

• Injury benefits (weekly indemnity).

• Medical expenses.

The limits payable and the duration of payments vary with each of the above categories. These payments are made voluntarily. However, there is no obligation on the insurer to make payment in the following instances:

• When the residence employee or their representative refuses to accept these benefits.

• When the residence employee sues the insured.

A residence employee, or anyone acting on their behalf who accepts these benefits, must sign a release giving up any right to sue the insured. The insurer has the right to subrogate against anyone other than the insured who is responsible for the residence employee’s injury or death.

8.7.6 Coverage I: Loss Assessment (Applicable to Condominium Unit Owner Only)

The insurer will pay an additional amount up to 250% of Coverage A1 for the insured’s share of a special assessment if:

• The assessment is valid under the condominium corporation’s governing rules, and

• The assessment is made necessary by occurrence(s) to which Coverage E: Personal Liability applies.

The insurer will not pay for any part of an assessment made necessary by a deductible in the insurance policy of the condominium corporation.

8.7.7 Special Limitations

In Chapter 7 we learned that under Section I: Property Coverages, there are certain items of property and activities which are excluded as they are better insured under their own policy — for example, watercraft, motorized vehicles, business activities and its property, and aircraft. The Special Limitations section then puts coverage back on to specific items — such as owned watercraft, certain motorized vehicles, and business equipment — but with specific property limits assigned to each one. Since these items have now been put back onto the policy, we must provide liability coverage to these items. Each item has liability coverage restrictions.

8.7.7.1 Watercraft and Motorized Vehicles

For any watercraft and motorized vehicles owned by the insured, coverage is automatically provided for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of the following watercraft and motorized vehicles:

• Watercraft, including their attachments, equipped with an outboard motor or motors of not more than 12kW (16 hp) in total when used with or on a single watercraft.

• Watercraft, including their attachments, equipped with any other type of motor of not more than 38KW (50 hp).

• Non-motorized watercraft, including their attachments, not more than 8 metres (26 feet) in length.

Insureds who own watercraft must be advised of these coverage limitations. When the above specifications are exceeded, additional coverages must be purchased. In such cases, the details regarding the type and size of the watercraft or motors will be stated on the coverage summary page.

To ensure there are no gaps in coverage and to allow insureds a reasonable opportunity to put insurance coverage in place, newly acquired watercraft which exceed the special limitations stated in the policy are automatically covered for 30 days from the purchase date. If coverage is required after that date, the policy must be endorsed accordingly.

Let’s look at some of the other motorized vehicles that have special limits:

• Self-propelled lawn mowers, snow blowers, and garden-type tractors of not more than 19kW (25 hp). The limitation of coverage applies to motorized yard equipment which is self-propelled or capable of moving on its own. For example, insureds using push-type lawn mowers or snow blowers would not be affected by this limitation; however, if an insured owns maintenance equipment that exceeds these specifications, they must purchase additional coverage. Motorized golf carts while in use on a golf course. Coverage for injury or damage arising out of the use of owned golf carts is limited to accidents on the golf course. There is no coverage for the operation of golf carts on the insured’s premises or any location which is not a golf course.

• Motorized wheelchairs, including motorized scooters having more than two wheels and specifically designed for the carriage of a person who has a physical disability.

8.7.7.1.1 Non-Owned Watercraft and Motorized Vehicles

Coverages for watercraft and motorized vehicles not owned by the insured — for example, borrowed from a friend — are described below. “Non-owned” means it is not owned by anyone who is deemed an insured under the definition of an insured policy, as shown on page 1 of the policy. This coverage applies to an insured against claims arising out of their use or operation of:

• Any type of watercraft.

• Any self-propelled land vehicle, amphibious vehicle, or air cushion vehicle, provided that the vehicle is not subject to motor vehicle registration and is designed primarily for use off public roads. Examples of non-owned motorized vehicles for which liability coverage is provided include dirt bikes, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, and golf carts.

• Additionally, the motorized vehicle or watercraft must not be owned by any person insured by this policy.

Coverage is provided for injury or damage arising out of the use or operation of all non-owned watercraft. As with other property owned, used, occupied, or leased by the insured, there is no coverage for actual damage caused to the watercraft itself.

This is broader coverage than is provided to insureds who own their own watercraft. The logic is that insureds who own certain boats ought to know of their increased liability exposure and will have taken steps to put coverage in place. The same logic cannot be applied to an insured who may use nonowned watercraft. To ensure there are no gaps in coverage, the insurer agrees to cover the insured’s liability for injury or damage arising out of all non-owned watercraft, regardless of their type or size of motor(s).

As broad as the coverage may appear, there are certain watercraft and motorized vehicles that insurers will not insure. There is no coverage for injury or damage arising out of the use or operation of any watercraft or motorized vehicle — whether owned by the insured or not — while it is:

• Used for carrying passengers for compensation.

• Used for business purposes.

• Used in any race or speed test.

• Rented to others.

• Used or operated without the owner’s consent, if the insured is not the owner.

8.7.7.2 Trailers

Coverage is provided for injury or damage arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of any trailer or its equipment, provided such trailer is not attached to, carried on, or being towed by a motorized vehicle subject to motor vehicle registration. For example, injury or damage caused by a camper trailer which rolls off its site at a local campground could be insured by this policy. A house trailer parked beside the residence in the off-season could be used occasionally while parked. The trailer itself would not be covered, but liability arising from its use would be covered. Damage caused to others while the trailer is in motion, and becomes disconnected from a towing vehicle, would fall under the automobile policy.

8.7.7.3 Business and Business Property

Business is defined in the policy as “any continuous or regular pursuit undertaken for financial gain including a trade, profession or occupation.” Business activities of insureds are generally required to be covered under a commercial liability policy.

In the past, there was a clear division between the workplace and the home. As we learned in Section 7.8.11: Home Business Extension Endorsement, that line has blurred as the world of business has changed. Due to advanced digital communication tools, many people no longer commute to work, and their home now includes their workspace. In many cases, the business operates entirely out of the home environment.

Although business pursuits or business use of the premises are excluded under Section II: Liability Coverages, there are exceptions. The insurer agrees to provide coverage for liabilities relating to the following business activity scenarios:

• The insured’s personal actions during the course of their trade, profession, or occupation which are not related directly to their trade, profession, or occupation. For example, Cole is an accountant operating out of his home. If a client were to visit for an appointment and happened to be bitten by his dog, Cole would be covered for a claim arising from the dog bite. However, he would not be covered for his actions as an accountant, which would be covered under his professional liability policy.

• The occasional rental to others of the portion of the dwelling usually occupied by the insured as a private residence. If Nav goes to Florida for three months in the winter and rents out her premises while she is away, she would be covered for claims arising out of the dwelling premises.

• The rental to others of a one-, two-, or three-family dwelling usually occupied by the insured as a residence, provided no family unit includes more than two roomers or boarders. The rental of a spare room to one or two students would be covered.

• The rental of space in the insured’s residence to others for incidental office, school, or studio occupancy.

• The rental to others, or the holding for rent, of not more than three car spaces or stalls in garages or stables.

• The temporary or part-time business pursuits of an insured person under the age of 21. This provides coverage for summer lawn cutting, babysitting, or other temporary pursuits.

Claims arising from any other business pursuit or operation are insured only if liability coverage for it is shown on the coverage summary page.

8.7.8 Exclusions of Coverage

As we know, exclusions are the norm, and Section II: Liability Coverages is no exception. In addition to the list of exclusions, there is no coverage for claims arising from:

• War, invasion, or act of a foreign enemy.

• Business pursuits or any business use of the premises except as provided under the Business and Business Property section.

• The rendering or failure to render any professional service. The law puts a higher standard of duty on those having specialized skill or knowledge, and persons providing such service should purchase professional liability insurance.

• Bodily injury or property damage caused by any intentional or criminal act or failure to act by:

- Any person insured by this policy, or

- Any other person at the direction of any person insured by this policy.

• Sexual, physical, psychological, or emotional abuse from molestation or harassment, including corporal punishment by, at the direction of, or with the knowledge, of any person insured by this policy, or

- Failure of any person insured by this policy to take steps to prevent sexual, physical, psychological, or emotional abuse, molestation, harassment, or corporal punishment.

• The transmission of communicable disease by any person insured by the policy.

• The ownership, use, or operation of:

- Any aircraft.

- Premises used as an airport or landing facility and all activities related to either.

Note: Insurers have different property policies and, as such, may have different exclusions concerning the legal cultivation of cannabis. It is important to check the individual wordings for each company.

8.8 PERSONAL UMBRELLA POLICIES

“How much is too much?” is a question often asked when dealing with a product such as liability insurance. Though many companies have a minimum limit to be applied to all policies, the upper limit is variable and depends on the exposures presented by the insured and the appetite of the company to provide a higher limit. A thorough analysis of an insured will show areas where a higher limit is required or where extra coverage is required because of an exclusion on the primary policy. For the insured, the risks may be identified and increased limits may be required, but the primary insurer may be unable to provide the limits and coverage that is required by the insured.

Image

Every insurer has limits on the amount of insurance it can write on a primary policy, be it property or automobile. They may have specific limits noted in their underwriting to control their exposures, or they may not have reinsurance in place to take on increased limits. This leaves the insured in a situation where they may have to purchase a separate policy to give themselves the increased protection they require. They can either purchase an excess policy or an umbrella policy.

An excess policy will provide the same coverages and exclusions as the primary policy and will only pay when the primary policy limits are exhausted. Where extra coverage is required because of an exclusion in the primary the insured can buy an umbrella policy.

To be eligible for an umbrella liability policy, insureds must provide the insurer with evidence that they already have existing or primary liability policies in place for any known exposures, such as automobile, watercraft, aviation, or residences.

When there is a claim, the umbrella liability policy will pay only when:

• There is not enough insurance under the primary policy. If the primary policy has a limit of $2 million, this limit must be exhausted before the umbrella policy pays in excess of this limit.

• There is no coverage provided under the primary policy. In this scenario, the umbrella policy will pay as the primary policy, provided it does not contain the same exclusions as the primary policy. This is called the “drop down” feature. In this case, there is a self-insured retention (SIR) amount (which varies from company to company) if this umbrella becomes the primary insurer. This SIR functions as a deductible.

8.9 OTHER LIABILITY POLICIES

8.9.1 Commercial Liability

The purpose of this section is to make you aware of the overall nature of commercial liability and to help you understand that it is much more complex in its coverages and application than the personal liability coverage we just described. We’ll cover a general overview of a commercial liability policy and some of its features. However, you’ll need to study beyond this textbook to serve the needs of a commercial client.

Just as a habitational policy is issued with personal liability included, so a commercial property policy includes commercial liability. While all habitational policies comprise the same policy coverages, commercial liability is underwritten based on the activities and risk associated with each commercial risk. This means the one-size-fits-all approach does not apply to commercial insurance. The insuring agreement is the same, and the supplemental payments are the same, but the activities of the business will determine the coverages, rates, and limits.

These coverages and rates can be affected by events far from the location of the individual insured. Disasters and catastrophes around the world have an influence on reinsurance rates, which directly affect individual rates and availability of coverage.

The form used in Canada is the Commercial General Liability (CGL) Policy (IBC 2100). This policy is 22 pages in length, and it is quite detailed and extensive. It is broad enough in scope to be able to respond to the liability exposures of individuals, corporations, general or limited partnerships, societies (such as clubs or religious groups), and government bodies. However, as with all policies, there are exclusions and the broker should do a thorough analysis of the insured to be aware of these exclusions and bring them to the attention of the insured.

Similar to habitations, businesses also have the general liability exposures based on the condition of their premises and their operations or activities. Whether the business is a retail operation (such as a hardware store catering to the public) or a manufacturing operation with no public access, there is a liability exposure. An appliance store has both on- and off-premises exposure in the showroom and the installation of appliances in customers’ homes. There is an exposure for medical payments if a visitor injures themselves on-site, just like Section F: Voluntary Medical Payments in a Homeowner Policy. A tenant in a building has a tenant’s legal liability exposure based on its care, custody, and control of the space it leases and occupies.

However, businesses do have some unique exposures that habitational policies don’t:

• Tenant’s legal liability: When a business owns a building, damage to the building would come under the building section of their property policy. When a business rents or leases a property, they have an exposure in tort law for damage to the property in their care, custody, and control. Section A of the liability policy excludes payment for damages to premises they occupy. This gap in coverage is provided by tenant’s legal liability insurance. The coverage is limited to payment for only those losses for which the tenant is legally liable in tort (negligent); liabilities assumed under contract are excluded but can be insured under a separate policy. The amount purchased should be no less than the value of the building or portion of the building occupied.

• Product liability: Generally, a product is anything sold by the insured. Consumers have the right to expect that the goods they purchase will be safe. When their use results in injury or damage, consumers have a right to take legal action against the party that made or sold the defective product. Business liability policies provide coverage for this exposure.

• Completed operations liability: When completed work is put to its intended use and injury or damage results, the party responsible for the work may be sued for damages. Appliance repair shops and plumbing, heating, and electrical contractors all have a completed operations liability exposure.

• Personal and advertising injury liability: Personal and advertising injury means injury, including consequential bodily injury, arising out of one or more of the following offences:

- Libel and slander.

- Malicious persecution.

- Wrongful entry or eviction.

- Invasion of privacy.

- False arrest.

- Detention or imprisonment.

- Unauthorized use of another’s advertising idea.

In an action alleging personal injury, the wronged party may seek damage for extreme humiliation, stress, or other personal injury.

• Hold harmless agreement: Also known as a hold harmless clause or hold harmless provision, this is a clause in a legal contract that absolves one party of legal liability for any injuries or damages suffered by another party. It plays a crucial role in a business transaction where the risk of injury is high. It is essentially a risk transfer mechanism and an indication of the extent of risk each party is prepared to assume. Careful drafting of the clause determines the extent of the protection the clause will provide the recipient of the hold harmless agreement.

For example, a homeowner having their roof repaired would have the roofer sign a hold harmless agreement to absolve the homeowners from liability if the roofer were to fall off the roof. A hold harmless clause is also printed on the back of a ski lift ticket absolving the ski operator from liability if the skier were to be injured on the hill. Commercially, a tenant may have to sign a hold harmless agreement absolving the landlord from any liability for damage if caused by the landlord. By signing or accepting the form, the signer has acknowledged the risks and agreed to accept them.

The hold harmless agreement does not always protect the person or company against a lawsuit or liability. The agreement must specifically state that the signer is waiving their rights to sue for negligence. Such agreements can be disregarded if they are vague or overly broad in language or believed to be fraudulent.

The CGL Policy also provides:

• Blanket contractual coverage for liability assumed by the insured, such as lease of premises, a side-track agreement, and other agreements.

• Contingent employer’s liability, which protects the insured for bodily injury to employees on whose behalf contributions are made by, or required to be made by, the insured under the provisions of any workers’ compensation law. If the workers’ compensation plan does not respond to a claim, the employer’s liability would respond.

• Owner’s and contractor’s protective liability, which provides the insured with coverage arising from the activities of a general contractor or sub-contractors.

These policies can also be extended by endorsement to include:

• Garage liability, which responds to the exclusion under the CGL Policy for payment for injury or damage to others arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of any automobile. This covers third-party liability for owned and non-owned vehicles and legal liability arising out of damage to customers’ automobiles while under their care, custody, and control.

• Limited environmental liability, which provides coverage for the sudden and accidental discharge, dispersal, release, or escape of pollutants. This coverage is only available on a selective basis.

• Employer’s bodily injury liability, which covers the insured with respect to claims of bodily injury to an employee not covered by workers’ compensation and arising out of and in the course of employment.

• It is important that both the broker and the insured understand the extent to which coverage is limited by Section III of the policy. Payment is based on both the Aggregate and Occurrence limit. In Personal lines there is no aggregate limit applied to the policy.

The aggregate limit stated on the policy is the most the policy will pay during the policy period for all claims for which insurance is provide28.

For example, if the policy contains a $2M aggregate limit, the insurer is not responsible for damages awarded more than that amount, whether by way of a single action or several actions, within the policy period. The policy may also state that there is a maximum payable per occurrence, say of $1M, with an aggregate of $2M. During the policy term, there are three losses; one for $1M, a second for $1.5M, and a third for $1.5M.

The first loss would be paid to the limit. The second loss would be capped at $1M, due to occurrence limit on the policy, therefore the insured would be responsible for $500,000. This second loss also breaches the $2M aggregate limit, therefore any subsequent claims, such as the third loss, would totally be the responsibility of the insured to pay.

Each of the many and varied policy wordings have definitions and exclusions particular to the them. It is important to know your client, know the company, and know the wordings!

8.9.2 Professional Liability

Although the CGL Policy is broad, it is not designed to insure the special liability needs of professionals — that’s where professional liability insurance comes in. The focus of professional liability policies is to provide payment for damages arising out of the rendering or failure to render professional services.

A professional is someone who possesses or claims to possess the special knowledge and skill necessary to render a professional service. When that knowledge or skill is deficient and financial or other injury results, a claim for damages may be initiated against the professional.

There are two major classes of professionals, including:

1) Those who administer health care, such as doctors, dentists, and pharmacists. Malpractice insurance will cover their legal liability arising out of the rendering or failure to render their professional service.

2) Those who give advice and counselling, such as lawyers, accountants, architects, and insurance and real estate brokers. Professionals having this exposure can buy errors and omissions (E&O) insurance to cover their exposure.
Occurrence-Based Policy Form 	Claims Made Policy form
The insurance company that was on the risk at the time the loss occurred will respond to the claim. 	The insurance company that is on the risk at the time the claim is made will respond.

These policies are written on a Claims Made Policy Form (IBC 2200), which is different from an Occurrence-based Policy Form (IBC 2100). The key difference between these two policies is that, under an Occurrence-based Policy, the insurance company that was on the risk at the time the loss occurred will respond to the claim. With a Claims Made Policy, the insurance company that is on the risk at the time the claim is made will respond. For many types of losses, the occurrence date may be indeterminate, but the date of the claim can be determined. For example, the exposure to asbestos may have occurred over a long period of time, making it hard to determine a fixed date of exposure; but the date of its manifestation as a cancer can be determined. These forms are highly detailed, and you’ll have to study them closely to be fully aware of the difference.

8.9.3 Commercial Umbrella Liability

In some cases, the liability policies purchased by the business may not address their complete liability insurance needs. Potential problems include:

• Inadequate limits because the primary insurer denied increased limits due to its own restrictions regarding reinsurance facilities and capacity.

• Inadequate coverage.

In these situations, providing an umbrella liability policy, as well as additional limits and broader policy coverages, can solve these problems. The umbrella policy is designed to respond only after the underlying or primary policy has responded. In the event of inadequate coverage under the primary policy, the insured must pay a deductible or self-insured retention (SIR) for additional coverage. This encourages the insured to buy adequate insurance for obvious liability exposure on the primary policy.

The application for umbrella liability coverage is quite extensive due to the nature of the policy. Furthermore, coverage cannot be bound by the broker — the policy comes into effect only after acceptance by the insurer. It’s also important to note that understanding the exclusions under an umbrella policy is just as important as understanding the exclusions under a primary policy.

8.10 CONCLUSION

This concludes our look at liability insurance, which is a mix of both legal history and specific policy wordings from the Homeowner Policy, Section II: Liability Coverages. You might be surprised at the broad range of risks that insureds can be liable for! This is a key area of insurance that will take time to fully comprehend but also to effectively apply. We recommend working with a mentor and asking questions of both your principal broker, your clients, and your underwriters to help you properly protect your clients and what they do.
