9.1 INTRODUCTION

Automobile insurance in Ontario is a universal coverage that is both simple and complex.

It’s simple because the provincial government regulates what the drivers are required to have in their policies and the associated coverages. This creates consistency between all insurers’ products, and helps the consumer know what to expect at the time of a claim.

It’s complex because the provincial government included policy conditions to help clarify who is responsible at the time of a claim, but, in turn, also imposed strict guidelines in how insurers can administer their policies to adapt to a changing market.

One fact for any insurance broker is this: you will be dealing with a lot of automobile clients. How this policy was created — and how it links to government regulations — will be a necessary piece of knowledge when you discuss coverages with your clients.

This chapter consists of three parts:

1) Part 1: Background of Automobile Insurance.

2) Part 2: The Owner’s Policy (OAP 1).

3) Part 3: Facility Association, the Role of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario, and Standard Policy Forms.

Throughout this chapter, we’ve included excerpts from the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1) wording to highlight key areas in the policy that you should know. We’ve also included a very important section immediately following Part 2, called Section 9.3.10: Ontario Policy Change Forms. This section lists and describes the major forms used to make changes, or endorsements, to the OAP 1. The OAF is not included with this textbook as it changes from time to time.

9.2.1 Introduction

Automobile accidents often result in injury, death, and loss to property. These losses amount to billions of dollars each year. Automobile owners need to protect themselves against the financial consequences of automobile accidents.

An automobile insurance policy can be purchased to provide coverage for:

• Third-party liability.

• Personal injury without regard to fault (accident benefits).

• Loss of or damage to the insured automobile.

9.2.2 Different Insurers across Canada

Automobile insurance is not the same in all provinces. In different provinces, automobile insurance is provided by private insurers, compulsory government insurance plans, and pure nofault and threshold no-fault insurance plans. We’ll look at the details of each of these insurers.

9.2.2.1 Private Insurers

Motorists in Alberta, Ontario, and the Atlantic provinces insure their automobiles with private insurers. In the majority of these provinces, coverage is provided by the Standard Policy Form (SPF) No. 1: Standard Automobile Policy (Owner’s Form), which was developed by the insurance industry for automobile owners. In the province of Ontario, the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1) is used to cover automobiles.

Insureds can use several standard endorsement forms (SEFs) to modify the coverages provided by this policy. In Ontario, the endorsements are available under the Ontario Policy Change Forms (OPCFs).

9.2.2.2 Compulsory Government Insurance Plans

The governments of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have established compulsory government insurance plans for all motorists residing in those provinces. The coverages are different for each province, as shown in the graph below.
Province 	Third-party liability 	Accident benefits 	Physical damage
British Columbia 	$200,000 	Included 	Optional
Saskatchewan 	$200,000 	Included 	$500 deductible
Manitoba 	$200,000 	Included 	$400 deductible

All automobile owners are automatically entitled to purchase insurance equivalent to the minimum compulsory limits established by law. For this reason, provinces having compulsory government automobile insurance plans do not operate under the Facility Association. (Refer to Section 9.4.1 for more about the Facility Association.)

Private insurers compete with government insurance plans in these provinces for excess coverages only. These include:

• Increased third-party liability limits.

• Addition of physical damage coverages (British Columbia).

• Reduction of physical damage deductible (Saskatchewan and Manitoba).

When sold by private insurers, excess coverages are issued on a separate policy. Changes to these policies are generally made on the SEFs.

In Quebec, the government maintains a monopoly on personal injury coverages for accidents occurring in that province. Other coverages may be purchased from private insurers.

9.2.2.3 Pure No-Fault and Threshold No-Fault Insurance Plans

Some provinces have implemented “no-fault” automobile insurance plans. While these plans are not all the same, their primary purpose is to provide benefits to persons injured in automobile accidents, regardless of who is at fault.

A pure no-fault plan removes the right of legal action against drivers who cause injury or death to others. Instead, all accident victims (or their legal representatives) may claim compensation from their own insurers. This plan is used in Manitoba and Quebec.

A threshold no-fault plan is used in Ontario. Under this plan, legal action against the responsible party is not permitted unless a certain threshold is exceeded. The threshold requires two conditions that must be met for legal action against the negligent owner/driver (we’ll discuss these later in the chapter, in Section 9.3.6: Fault Determination Rules).

9.2.2.4 Facility Association

Insurance coverage must be available for every licensed driver. However, when an applicant fails to meet the underwriting standards established by the insurer (that is, if their record is not a risk an insurer wants to add to their book), coverage may be denied.
Has Facility Association 	Does Not Have Facility Association
Alberta 	British Columbia
New Brunswick 	Manitoba
Newfoundland & Labrador 	Saskatchewan
Northwest Territories 	Quebec
Nova Scotia 	
Nunavut 	
Ontario 	
Prince Edward Island 	
Yukon 	

Each of the provinces that participates in the Facility Association to ensure the availability of coverage for applicants who are refused insurance, also known as a pool. All insurers writing automobile liability insurance are members and share in the pooled results. When persons insured are unable to qualify for coverage in the marketplace, they are removed from the pool. We’ll learn more about the Facility Association in Section 9.4.1.

9.2.3 Ontario Application for Automobile Insurance: Owner’s Form (OAF 1)

The information necessary to properly underwrite, rate, and issue an automobile insurance policy is taken from a completed and signed application form. In Ontario, this form is the Ontario Application for Automobile Insurance: Owner’s Form (OAF 1).

To understand how the policy functions, let’s look at what it is asking the applicants. The insurer requires that all questions contained in the application be answered fully. More than one automobile can be insured by the same policy. Also, as this application is used to insure both private passenger and commercial automobiles, it contains questions specific to both uses. For commercially rated vehicles, the applicant must complete a separate commercial/public automobile supplement.

The OAF is not included with this textbook as it changes from time to time. To get the most current version of the OAF 1, go to this link and download the PDF form.

https://www.fsrao.ca/oaf-1-ontario-application-automobile-insurance-owners-form

9.2.3.1 Section 1: Name and Postal Address

The information in Section 1: Name and Postal Address is important for various reasons.

Before agreeing to provide the applicant with insurance, the insurer will request a driver history (also known as a “driver abstract”) from the provincial licensing body. Errors in providing the driver abstract are less likely to occur when the full name and address of the applicant are provided to the insurer.

The territory in which the automobile will be used has a bearing on the potential for loss. The insurer anticipates that the described automobile is in, and will be chiefly used in, the vicinity of the applicant’s address. If that assumption is incorrect, the applicant must provide all details. The application also requires that both the applicant’s residence and business telephone numbers be stated.

If the automobile being insured is leased, the lessor’s full name and postal address must be provided.

9.2.3.2 Section 2: Policy Period

The coverage begins at the time the application is taken and expires at 12:01 a.m. the local time at the address of the insured. This time and location is important because Ontario has different time zones. If an accident happens at 12:01 a.m. in Ottawa and another one happens simultaneously in Kenora, Kenora’s time of accident will be 11:01 p.m. This critical time difference means one automobile policy just expired, whereas the other has not.

Policies are normally issued for 12 months, meaning they need to be renewed yearly.

9.2.3.3 Section 3: Details of the Described Automobile

In the event of a claim, the insurer will want to be certain that the automobile for which coverage is being claimed is insured under the policy. When completing Section 3: Details of the Described Automobile, the applicant must provide the vehicle’s model, year, make or trade name, body type, cylinders or displacement, gross vehicle weight, and vehicle identification number (VIN). They must also disclose whether the vehicle is owned or leased, when it was purchased or leased, and the purchase price, including options and taxes. Other questions pertain to use of the vehicle: commuting distance to work (one way), annual driving distances, details of any carpooling, type of fuel (gas or diesel), and disclosure of any unrepaired damages. Any modifications — such as non-factory wheels, electronic equipment, or fancy paint alterations — must be added to the Remarks section. In the OAF 1, page 2, Special Note 1 specifies a $1,500 limit on after-factory installed electronic accessories and equipment in the vehicle.

The applicant must also provide the name and address of any lienholder and a declaration as to the applicant being the registered owner and the actual owner. A copy of the vehicle registration identifies the owner of the vehicle, and the policy must be in the name registered with the Ministry of Transportation.

The policy contains exclusions for certain uses of the vehicle. The applicant must indicate if the vehicle is being rented or leased, carrying passengers for compensation or hire, hauling a trailer, or carrying explosives or radioactive materials. If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” the applicant may require additional coverage by endorsement.

The final question asks for the total number of automobiles in the household. This includes vehicles belonging to other household members (for example, vehicles belonging to the applicant’s children or company-supplied vehicles). Note that if any of these vehicles are already insured on another policy, they would not be included in this application. This question allows the underwriter to check the history of these drivers; if their history is found to be not satisfactory, the underwriter may want to exclude them from the applicant’s policy.

This information is also important for rating purposes when physical damage coverages are required. Insurers maintain information on the costs to repair or replace various makes and models of automobiles. Generally, repair costs increase as the value of the automobile increases. This means that insureds having expensive automobiles will pay a higher premium for physical damage coverages than owners of lesser-value automobiles. Some insurers also charge more for insuring certain types of highpowered or customized cars.

In a recent trend, automobile manufacturers have added more sophisticated equipment into previously hollow parts, like bumpers or side mirrors. Now, they have cameras, proximity sensors, or accelerometers, making these once cheap replacement parts much more expensive. Sometimes it’s not just the brand name that makes a vehicle expensive — it’s the parts that go into it.

To assist the insurer in the settlement of future claims, the applicant is also required to provide the following information:

• If leased by the applicant: name and address of the lessor.

• If purchased by the applicant: new or used, date, and value (including equipment).

• Name and address of any lienholder or mortgagee.

When others have a financial interest in the automobile being insured (such as a mortgagee), their interest is recorded and protected in the event of a loss.

9.2.3.4 Section 4: Driver Information

Automobile insurance policies permit the use of the automobile by persons not named on the policy. Section 4: Driver Information is designed to identify anyone who will regularly or occasionally use the insured automobile.

The applicant is required to provide the following information:

• Names of all drivers (as shown on their driver’s licenses).

• Approximate percentage of their use of the automobile.

• Number of years licensed.

If drivers have graduated from a driver training course, a copy of that certificate should be included with the application. If there are other licensed drivers in the household, they must also be listed in the Remarks section.

The OAF 1 also asks whether any of the drivers qualify for a retiree discount. Special Note 2: Retiree Discount explains the qualification requirements to obtain this discount. The discount applies if the principal operator:

• Is retired.

• Is age 65 or older or receiving a pension.

• Has no earned income.

• Is not working.

• Has not been employed for the last 26 weeks in the last 52 weeks.

• Is not operating a business.

It also indicates that, if the applicant qualifies, they must sign a declaration that they are a retiree.

Near the end of this section, the applicant must provide information about their most recent insurer, including the policy number and expiry date.

Further questions ask whether the applicant knows of:

• Any suspensions or cancellations of the driver’s licenses of any listed driver within the last six years.

• Any cancellation of insurance within the last three years for the applicant or any listed driver.

• Any claim denied for material misrepresentation within the past three years for the applicant or any listed driver.

• Any fraud connected with automobile insurance by the applicant or any listed driver. (There is no time restraint on this question.)

If the answer to any of the above questions is “yes”, the applicant must provide details in the Remarks section.

9.2.3.5 Section 5: Previous Accidents and Insurance Claims

In Section 5: Previous Accidents and Insurance Claims, the applicant must provide details of any and all previous accidents and claims for the last six years. This information applies to all owned vehicles, or use or operation of any automobile, including where they were listed as a driver. Any accidents that occurred while the applicant was driving a non-owned automobile (such as an employer’s) must also be disclosed.

The previous accident and claim information must include the following, to the best of the applicant’s knowledge: drivers, vehicles, dates, types of claim, and amounts paid.

9.2.3.6 Section 6: History of Convictions

The insurer will carefully screen all applicants to ensure that insurance is not provided to anyone who has an undesirable driver history. They will check the applicant’s convictions history from the previous three years, including offences for impaired driving, speeding, and failure to yield the right of way. Even though offences may not have resulted in an accident, they may point to poor driving habits or a disregard for the law.

Section 6: History of Convictions requires the date and description of each conviction.

9.2.3.7 Section 7: Rating Information

Section 7: Rating Information is for the insurance broker or company to develop the rating information based on all the previous sections of the application. It will indicate:

• The driving class.

• Driving record for each section of the policy.

• Claim or conviction surcharges.

• Vehicle price or code.

• Applicable rate groups for accident benefits.

• Direct compensation and physical damage.

• Location and territory.

• Any discounts that may apply.

This section will determine the premium to be charged for the coverages selected in Section 8: Insurance Coverages Applied For.

9.2.3.8 Section 8: Insurance Coverages Applied For

Section 8: Insurance Coverages Applied For allows the applicant to select the coverages required, including any optional increased accident benefits or endorsements. They may also select limits and deductibles.

A total premium is shown per vehicle; however, the applicant needs to be informed that the policy premium shown is an estimated premium and subject to adjustment or confirmation by the insurer. The applicant also needs to be informed that there will be a minimum premium charge if the applicant cancels their policy.

9.2.3.9 Section 9: Remarks

Section 9: Remarks allows the applicant to provide further details for any of the above application sections.

9.2.3.10 Section 10: Method of Payment

Section 10: Method of Payment identifies the type of payment plan, estimated policy premium, tax, interest, and total estimated cost. Separate boxes are for amount paid, balance owing, number of remaining installments, amount of each installment, and due date.

9.2.3.11 Section 11: Declaration of Applicant

Section 11: Declaration of Applicant is where the applicant signs to attest that they understand the purpose and factual accuracy of the information they have provided, including that the drivers:

• Must not suffer from mental or health-related disabilities that will interfere with the ability to drive safely.

• Must not be addicted to alcohol or drugs to the extent that it will interfere with their ability to drive safely.

• Must notify the Ministry of Transportation if they become physically or emotionally disabled to the extent that it will interfere with their ability to drive safely.

The applicant warrants that all drivers are qualified to hold a driver’s license and that all completed sections of the application are correct. Warning is given for false statements, misrepresentations, and fraud.

The Insurance Act requires that the insured be given clear warning of the consequences for making a false statement on the application for insurance and any subsequent claim brought under the policy. Generally, the right to recover under the policy is forfeited when the insured:

• Provides a false description of the automobile being insured which is to the prejudice of the insurer. For example, manufacturers normally make two or more models of the same automobile. When the difference between them is substantial, the premium required to insure them may vary significantly. When an applicant seeking a lower premium describes the automobile as being of a lesser model than it actually is, such description prejudices the position of the insurer.

• Knowingly misrepresents the risk or fails to disclose a required fact. Misrepresentation can often be traced to the applicant’s statements regarding previous accidents, refusals of insurance, or the intended use of the vehicle.

• Breaches a policy term. The most common contraventions are usually of those set out in the Statutory Conditions.

• Commits a fraud. Fraud is committed, for example, when insureds attempt to claim for loss or damage to the automobile which was deliberately caused by them.

• Willfully makes a false statement in respect of a claim. The word “willfully” suggests that the insured intends to deceive the insurer into paying for a claim which is not insured by the policy. False statements typically concern the consumption of alcohol, the amount of the loss, the identity of the driver, and consent to use the automobile.

The applicant warrants the truth of all statements made in the application for insurance and further agrees to permit the insurer to obtain, from any source, reports containing personal, credit, factual, investigative, or driver record information in connection with the application, renewal, extension, or variation thereof.

When insurers need to verify the truth of the information contained in the application, they rely on two common sources: (1) Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation or such other provincial registry having jurisdiction and (2) the applicant’s previous insurer, the name of which must be disclosed in the application, if applicable.

9.2.3.12 Section 12: Report of Broker/Agent

Section 12: Report of Broker/Agent is completed by the broker/agent and indicates:

• If the coverage has been bound.

• If the business is new to the broker.

• The type of liability card issued (for example, temporary or permanent).

• If the applicant is known to the broker.

• How long the broker has known the principal driver.

9.2.4 Take All Comers Rule

As we have read earlier, the Insurance Act in Ontario makes automobile insurance mandatory in the province for any driver on the road. As such, there has also been some consumer protection built onto the legislation, ensuring that all consumers are able receive a quotation for automobile insurance, at a fair price according to the rates and regulations filed by auto insurers with FSRA, to help enforce this law. The Ontario law prohibits insurers from denying a basic auto policy to anyone, except on grounds filed with the regulator. This law is known as the “take all comers rule” (TAC). Any insurer caught failing to comply with this legislation can face a varying range and degree of punishments from FSRA.

For brokers, however, it is their responsibility to provide the best possible coverage at the lowest possible price that meets the client’s needs. To do that, a broker must go to all available insurers their brokerage has to seek auto quotes for their customers. If an insurer fails to provide a quotation on an application for a client, it is then up to the broker to inform the customer of this act of the insurer, and also to document the situation accordingly. Whenever this situation is encountered, it is important for a broker to have thorough documentation and be able to explain the situation with their customer.

Let’s look at two brief examples;

Jarrod has had three claims in one year, and his policy is up for renewal. All of the claims were not-at-fault claims. Jarrod’s insurance company, however, responds to the renewal that may be a higher risk for future claims and refuses to offer a renewal on that reason. However, the insurer did not file that specific underwriting rule with FSRA. The insurer is therefore in violation of the TAC rule.

Myriam, a broker, enters a prospect’s auto application into the brokerage’s quoting system, but only four of their six markets provided her a quote. The client has a clean driving history. Recognizing the issue here, Myriam decides to verify why those two markets did not quote and also checks where she can try to obtain a quote from in another way. Myriam took detailed notes. Only after doing this work did Myriam contact her prospect and present all options to them, with explanations.

9.2.5 Approved Applications

The Insurance Act states that the submitted application must form an actual part of the whole contract. OAP 1, Section 1.1 states that

“The contract includes three documents:

• A completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance,

• A Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and

• This policy.”

When the application is acceptable to the insurer, the underwriter will issue the policy. For this reason, it is essential that all questions be answered fully and honestly.

Upon approval, the insurer will issue a Certificate of Automobile Insurance to the applicant. The certificate will include the information from the application, as well as the limits, deductibles, term of coverage, endorsements, and premium.

The front of the application has a brief explanation of the coverage sections. However, the coverage may not be the same as what was applied for, because the coverage is subject to decisions made by the insurer at the underwriting stage. Some common differences may be higher deductibles or additional restricting endorsements.

The certificate will indicate that the client can obtain a copy of the complete OAP 1 policy if requested. However, very few requests for complete policy wordings are ever made, so the Certificate of Automobile Insurance is the confirmation of coverage to the client.

9.2.6 Policy Renewals

When a policy is renewed, the insurer will issue a new Certificate of Automobile Insurance which indicates the new inception and expiration dates. If the insurer changes any other terms, the policy is deemed to be offered on a varied terms basis.

Additionally, if there are varied terms (for example, deductible limits are higher), the Ontario Insurance Act requires that the insurer give notice to the broker not less than 45 days prior to the renewal of such varied terms. The broker must similarly give notice to the client not less than 30 days before the renewal date. If the broker does not give the 30 days’ notice, the broker could be held responsible for the difference in the varied terms. In order to prevent errors and omissions (E&O) claims against the broker and/or the brokerage, brokers need to advise clients immediately when an insurer wishes to renew a policy on varied terms.

If an insurer does not wish to offer a renewal, this will also constitute a varied term. In these situations, the broker must either (1) replace the policy with an alternate insurer or (2) advise the client of the insurer’s position at least 30 days before the renewal date. Failing to advise the client within this time could make the broker responsible for the claim.

Effective since 1990, the Certificate of Automobile Insurance must disclose to the client how their policy is rated. However, it is not good enough to show a rate class 02 or 03 because this has little meaning to the general public — instead, the certificate must show an explanation of the rate class in plain language. This allows the insured to make an intelligent comparison of coverages and the criteria. This rate class disclosure includes chargeable claims, discounts that may be available, class description (02, 03, 07, etc.), driving record description, and surcharges.

9.3.1 Introduction to the OAP 1

In this section, we’ll examine all the component parts of the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1). Learning this content will help you during your exam (because knowing which sections contain specific information will help you quickly find the answers) and help you explain to your clients how their policies will work for them. Although the OAP 1 refers to coverages and amounts, it does not contain the schedule of those amounts, because the schedule is adjusted from time to time. You can find a summary of this schedule on IBAO’s website on Ontario Auto for reference,

https://www.ibao.org/materials/ontario-auto/

9.3.2 Plain Language Wordings

Ontario was the first province to approve a plain language automobile policy. “Plain language” means that the legal and insurance jargon and technical conditions found in old policies would be “translated” so that the general public could understand them.

The OAP 1 came into effect March 31, 1994. The policy has changed over time, but the most current version was approved for use on September 1, 2010 by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (the predecessor to the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario).

Using plain language wording helps average Ontario residents to easily understand their coverage on their own. In addition to the then-new policy format, new endorsement forms in Ontario were also written in plain language.

9.3.3 Mandatory Coverages

To ensure that no one being insured to drive in Ontario is left without necessary coverages, the Ontario government established a set of directives for the automobile insurance industry to bring in standardized, or mandatory, coverages.

On November 1, 1996, the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability Act, 1996 became law. This act set the minimum standard for all automobile insurance policy coverages in Ontario. One of the government’s main goals was to deter people from intentionally driving without insurance; as a result, the fine for this offence was increased to $5,000, up to a maximum of $25,000 for the first offence, and from $10,000 to a maximum of $50,000 for the second offence.

The act also set other basic ground rules and mandatory coverages for all licensed drivers in Ontario. Here’s an overview of these mandatory coverages — we’ll explore them in much greater detail later in the chapter.

9.3.3.1 Section 3: Liability Coverage

Since March 1, 1981, the minimum liability coverage in Section 3: Liability Coverage has been set to $200,000 for property damage and bodily injury, combined. If a claim reaches or exceeds this limit, then injury claims take priority, and the amount is apportioned as follows:

• $190,000 for bodily injury.

• $10,000 for property damage.

9.3.3.2 Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage

The accident benefits under Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage are often referred to as “nofault benefits” and are set out in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule (SABS). (The SABS can be found in Regulation 403/96 of the Insurance Act.) Although these are mandatory, the insured also has the option of purchasing additional accident benefits to supplement the basic mandatory benefits. The SABS includes:

• Income replacement benefit.

• Non-earner benefit.

• Caregiver benefit.

• Dependant care benefit.

• Medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits.

• Payment of other expenses.

• Death and funeral benefits.

• Optional benefits (for example, increased limits for the above benefits, indexation of benefits payable, etc.).

9.3.3.3 Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage

Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage provides protection for the insured, their spouses, and their children, as well as the operators of the described automobile, if they are struck and injured by an uninsured automobile.

9.3.3.4 Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage Coverage

Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage Coverage, known as DCPD, responds when there is damage to the insured’s automobile, its contents, or its loss of use due to an accident in Ontario that is not the insured’s fault.

On January 1, 2024, the Ontario Government made its first change to the OAP 1 by creating an opt-out option for consumers from the DCPD mandatory coverage. Known as OPCF 49: Agreement Not to Recover for Loss or Damage from an Automobile Collision, this endorsement permits the policyholder to not have DCPD on their policy if they are the legal owner of the vehicle (i.e. in other words, they are not leasing the vehicle). This change form also makes cascading changes to Section 7: Optional Coverages, specifically to collision and the comprehensive coverages, as those sections rely on DCPD being in place.

9.3.4 Optional Coverages

When we describe some coverages as “optional,” we do not mean they are “add-ons” or less necessary than the mandatory coverages — rather, these coverages extend the mandatory coverages into key areas that drivers will benefit from.

Optional coverages include the following:

• Increased liability limits: The minimum limits in Ontario are $200,000, but most policies are issued with higher limits, such as $1,000,000 or higher.

• Physical damage (loss or damage) coverages: These coverages are designed to indemnify policyholders for physical damage to their automobile. They may be called “all perils,” “collision,” “comprehensive,” or “specified perils” coverage. Each of them covers damage to the vehicle itself, as well as coverage for damage caused by different perils. A deductible (in variable amounts) always applies, unless the loss is caused by fire or lightning.

• Optional accident benefits coverages: Insureds can increase the coverage limits specified in the SABS to allow for better than standard coverage. We’ll discuss these limits, as well as the optional increases, in more detail in Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverages.

• Other coverage and/or policy changes: Optional coverage is provided through endorsements known as the Ontario Policy Change Forms (OPCFs). These forms are used to indicate changes to the basic provisions of the policy. Later in the chapter, we’ll look at the most common endorsements (Section 9.3.10: Ontario Policy Change Forms).

9.3.5 Notice of Accident

An insured person is required to report an accident to their automobile insurer within seven days of an accident if:

• The accident has been reported to the police under the Highway Traffic Act (for example, for injury, criminal acts, damage over $2000, etc.); or

• The accident will be reported to an agent or broker, regardless of who is at fault.

If the insured is unable to report the accident due to incapacity, they may comply with this condition by reporting the accident as soon as they regain the ability to do so. If a third party has a right of recovery against the policy, then that party may make the claim on their own behalf, as stated in the Statutory Conditions.

9.3.6 Fault Determination Rules

The Fault Determination Rules (which can be found in the Insurance Act, Regulation 668) contain examples of common types of collisions. The rules also describe how fault is assigned for insurance purposes — for example, by using the Fault Chart. The Fault Chart covers the most common types of accidents and includes diagrams illustrating the points of impact between two or more cars. The diagrams illustrate how to apportion fault between the vehicles. The Fault Chart rules are based on the rules of the road and tort law precedents set in past cases.

Let’s look at these examples.

If an insured disagrees with the liability derived from the Fault Determination Rules, they have the option of taking legal action against the insurer. If an insured disagrees with the amount of a settlement offered for damage to the vehicle, they can refer to OAP 1, Section 6.7.3: Settling a Claim and ask for an appraisal. In these situations, the insured and the insurer will each appoint an appraiser who will either agree on an amount or will appoint an umpire to decide between their respective positions.

9.3.7 Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card

Like other Canadian jurisdictions, Ontario requires proof of financial responsibility. As of March 1994, the Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card, commonly referred to as the “pink slip,” was introduced to Ontarians. This certificate clearly indicates coverage is provided within Canada and the United States.

9.3.8 Sections of the OAP 1

We’ll now take an in-depth look at the most important parts of the OAP 1. It’s important to learn the OAP 1 in its entirety. However, we’ll expand on some specific sections in the pages that follow. You’ll want to keep your copy handy as you review these sections!

9.3.8.1 Section 1: Introduction

Section 1: Introduction provides definitions of terms and explains information that applies to the entire policy. For example, it includes:

• Where the insured is covered.

• How to cancel the policy.

• Who and what the insurance company will not cover.

• Where to make a claim and who may make it.

9.3.8.1.1 Section 1.1: This Policy is Part of a Contract

“This policy is part of a contract between you and us. The contract includes three documents:

• A completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance,

• A Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and

• This policy.”

9.3.8.1.2 Section 1.2: Where You Are Covered (Territory)

“This policy covers you and other insured persons for incidents occurring in Canada, the United States of America and any other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, and on a vessel travelling between ports of those countries.

All of the dollar limits described in this policy are in Canadian funds.”

9.3.8.1.3 Section 1.3: Definitions

Under the OAP 1, the definition of an automobile includes the “described automobile” — that is, the automobile insured under the contract and described by its year, make, model, and serial number within the policy. But it can also mean a “newly acquired automobile,” “temporary substitute automobile,” or an all-encompassing “other automobile.” Each automobile defined is covered by the policy to varying degrees. The definition of an automobile under the OAP 1 also includes motorized snow vehicles, such as snowmobiles.

The policy defines an “excluded driver” as someone specifically not covered by the policy. The names of excluded drivers are always endorsed onto the policy using OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver Endorsement. This endorsement restricts all coverages (other than certain accident benefits coverages) if the excluded driver drives the described, newly acquired, temporary substitute, or other automobile as defined in the policy.

Note that the definition of “insured person” can change from one section to another. For example, in Section 1.3: Definitions, “named insured” is defined as “the person or organization to whom the Certificate of Automobile Insurance is issued.” However, persons covered under Section 3: Liability Coverage are “you [named insured], or anyone else in possession of the automobile with your consent, [who] uses or operates it.” Meanwhile, under Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage, insured persons “are defined in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule. In addition, insured persons also include any person who is injured or killed in an automobile accident involving the automobile and is not the named insured, or the spouse or dependant of a named insured, under any other motor vehicle liability policy, and is not covered under the policy of an automobile in which they were an occupant or which struck them.”

9.3.8.1.4 Section 1.4: Your Responsibilities

The policy states that, by accepting the OAP 1 contract, the insured agrees to the conditions listed in this section. It also states that if the insured fails to meet any of the listed conditions, then claims under the policy will be denied (with the exception of certain accident benefits). Let’s look at some of the key responsibilities.

9.3.8.1.4.1 Section 1.4.1

“You agree to notify us promptly and in writing of any significant change of which you are aware in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of a described automobile. [ . . . ] You must promptly tell us of any change in information supplied in your original application for insurance, such as additional drivers, or a change in the way a described automobile is used.”

This condition is derived from Section 8: Statutory Conditions of the policy. It reinforces the importance of keeping the details of the insurance contract accurate and up to date. Even small details — like the distance the vehicle is used to commute to work — need to be updated if, for example, the insured’s job changes.

All questions asked on an application are used for rating the policy; that is, they are all factors used in determining the premium to be charged. A short, two-kilometre drive to work will usually result in a lower premium than a 24-kilometre drive to work.

9.3.8.1.4.2 Section 1.4.5

“You agree not to drive or operate the automobile or allow anyone else to drive or operate the automobile, when not authorized by law.”

Conditions 1.4.5 and 1.4.6 are very important conditions within the contract. Collectively, they maintain coverage under the contract only when the vehicle is being used lawfully. Examples of people not authorized by law to drive include unlicensed drivers, those whose license is under suspension, and minors.

9.3.8.1.4.3 Section 1.4.6

“You agree not to use or allow anyone to use the automobile in a race or speed test or for any illegal trade or transportation.”

Using the vehicle in a race or speed test places both the vehicle and the passengers at greater risk of an accident than would normally be expected. This type of increased risk is not considered when calculating the premium for the policy.

As mentioned, the policy states that if the insured fails to meet any of the responsibilities in this section, claims under the policy (with the exception of certain accident benefits) will be denied. Correspondingly, this means that certain accident benefits will still be payable regardless of any breach of these conditions. For example, an excluded driver operating the vehicle will still qualify for the medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits if they are injured in an accident. (We’ll cover accident benefits in detail later in this chapter, in Section 9.3.8.4: Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.)

9.3.8.1.5 Section 1.6: Our Rights and Responsibilities

The three subsections that follow are each, in some way, related to the settlement of any dispute over money. Claims, premium payments, and premium over- and underpayments are all addressed here.

9.3.8.1.5.1 Section 1.6.1: Payment of Claims

“We will pay legitimate claims within 60 days of receiving a proof of loss. Some claims for Accident Benefits will be paid sooner. If we refuse to pay a claim, we will notify the insured person in writing explaining the reasons why we are not liable to pay.”

The policy refers here to a proof of loss. A proof of loss is a formal statement made by the insured to the insurer regarding a claim, giving details of the loss so the insurer can determine the extent of its liability.

After an accident, an insurance company will usually send the insured a proof of loss form to complete. It is essentially a blank piece of paper, and the insured is required to write an explanation of the events which led up to the accident, such as:

• The parties involved.

• Any witnesses who were present.

• The degree of damages.

• The amount claimed and any other insurable interest of others or incumbrances.

• All other pertinent details about the loss and the resulting claim.

Note that the policy states that legitimate claims will be paid within 60 days of the insurer receiving the proof of loss — not 60 days from the date of the accident.

Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage is designed to help the insured pay for any medical services they require. Since medical attention is often required immediately following an accident, certain components of Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage will be paid sooner than the prescribed 60 days.

9.3.8.1.5.2 Section 1.6.2: If You Have Been Incorrectly Classified and Your Premium is Wrong

“If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too high a premium, we will refund any premium overpayment with interest.

[ . . . ]

If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too low a premium, we will require you to pay an additional premium as long as we tell you within 60 days of the effective date of the policy. We will not charge you interest on the additional premium.”

Incorrect classifications occasionally happen. If an application is incorrectly read by an underwriter and a policy is issued based upon the error, the premium charged will most likely be incorrect. An error of this sort will not go against the insured. This section addresses both overpayment and underpayment situations. Notice the 60-day reclassification window available to the insurer.

If the insurer does not notice the underpayment within this time period, it must honour the premium quoted until the renewal of the policy. However, an overpayment by the insured is not subject to any such timeline. Overpayment, to the knowledge of the insurer, must always be refunded, regardless of when it occurred.

Note: An incorrect classification due to the omission or the misrepresentation of a material fact on an application is not subject to the same 60-day rule. If an applicant knowingly misrepresents facts to the prejudice of the insurer, the insurer may reclassify the risk at any point upon discovering the misrepresentation.

9.3.8.1.5.3 Section 1.6.3: Monthly Premium Payment Option

Section 1.6.3: Monthly Premium Payment Option allows the insurer to add an interest charge to the premium payable. This is only if the insured chooses to pay the premium over a 12-month period instead of a total payment upfront for the coverage period.

9.3.8.1.6 Section 1.7: Cancelling Your Insurance

As we learned earlier, the OAP 1 is written in plain language, and Section 1.7: Cancelling Your Insurance is a plain language restatement of Statutory Condition 11: Termination. This section explains the differences between an insurer’s cancellation and an insured’s cancellation of the policy.

Section 1.7.1: When You Cancel explains what happens when an insured cancels the policy. An insured can cancel their policy at any time. A refund, if any, is generated by calculating the portion of premium collected which is so far unused and subtracting an administrative charge from that amount. This is commonly referred to as a “short rate” refund. The unearned premium is returned to the insured, less the deducted fee.

Section 1.7.2: When We Cancel explains what happens when an insurer cancels the policy. An insurer can cancel the policy for any of the reasons listed in the wording under this section. This section mentions “reason[s] [ . . . ] filed with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority”; this refers to a process where every insurer files their own cancellation reasons with the FSRA. Every insurance company designs its own guidelines for risks it will accept and risks it deems to be outside its target market segment. Among other things, these rules include how many accidents and/or driving convictions (speeding tickets, etc.) a person can have before the company considers the risk too high to accept. These guidelines are then submitted to the FSRA for approval. If the FSRA decides the submissions are fair, the company is allowed to use the guidelines as its “declination rules” — that is, their reasons to decline a risk. If a policy is issued by a broker and it is later discovered that a driver listed on the automobile policy has more convictions than the company’s filed regulations allow, the company can cancel the policy within 60 days of its issuance. Any refund issued after an insurer has cancelled the policy will consist of the complete unearned premium collected (no administration charge is deducted). This is known as a “pro rata” or “proportionate basis” refund.

If there is a minimum retained premium stated in the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, that amount will not be refunded in either the short rate or the pro rata cancellation process.

Section 1.7.3: How We Can Cancel for Non-payment of Premium refers to the first two strikes of the so-called “three strikes” cancellation for non-payment process. If an insured is cancelled for nonpayment of premiums, the notification of cancellation must provide:

• 30 days’ notice, if sent by registered mail.

• 10 days’ notice, if hand delivered.

This notice must state the amount owed to the insurer at the time the notice is sent. The mailing or delivering of this notification meets the legal requirement for the insurer to provide “notice” — however, the 30- or 10-day notification period begins on the second day after the notice has been mailed (i.e. if the notice was mailed on a Monday, the notice begins on the Wednesday). The insured now has the option of allowing the policy to cancel on the stated date, or pay the amount stated on the notification which is owed to the insurer before noon of the business day prior to the stated cancellation date. If the insured pays the owed amount by that time, the cancellation procedure is stopped, and the policy remains in force as though no cancellation notice had been sent.

If the insured misses another payment and the insurer initiates the cancellation procedure for the second time, the same conditions would apply.

However, upon the third cancellation for non-payment, the cancellation notice becomes the same as a cancellation for any other reason, as explained in Section 1.7.4: How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons. The required notice period is 15 days from the day following the day of the notification mailing, or five days if personally hand delivered. The insurer is under no obligation to reinstate the policy — even if the amount owing is paid before the cancellation date. The two previous notification periods would have stated the amount owed at the time the notice was mailed or personally delivered; however, on the third notice, the amount stated is the amount owed to insure the policyholder until the stipulated cancellation date.

It is important to note the cancellation procedure resets itself upon each policy renewal. There must be three non-payments in a policy term before the cancellation can be delivered as described in Section 1.7.4: How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons.

9.3.8.1.6.1 Section 1.7.1: When You Cancel

“You may cancel your insurance at any time by advising us.

If you cancel, we will calculate the premium you owe on a short rate basis. Short rate means that the premium you owe will include our handling costs. We will refund anything due to you as soon as possible.

There may be a minimum premium set out in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.”

9.3.8.1.6.2 Section 1.7.2: When We Cancel

“Where your policy has been in effect for less than 60 days, we may only cancel your policy for a reason that we have filed with Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Where your policy has been in effect for more than 60 days, we may only cancel your policy for one of the following reasons:

• Non-payment of premium,

• You have given false particulars of the automobile to our prejudice,

• You have knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose information that you were required to provide in the application for automobile insurance, or

• The risk has changed materially.

If we cancel your policy, we will calculate the premium you owe on a proportionate basis. Proportionate means you will pay for the actual number of days you were covered. For example, if half the premium period is over, you will pay half the premium.

There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.

If you have paid more than the premium you owe, we will refund the difference on cancellation. Your refund may be delayed if the amount of premium you owe is subject to adjustment, or we are waiting for reports in order to determine the premium paid or owing. We will make the refund as soon as possible in that case.”

9.3.8.1.6.3 Section 1.7.3: How We Can Cancel for Non-Payment of Premium

“In case of non-payment of premium, we may give you a notice in writing. We must give you ten days notice if we deliver the notice in person, or 30 days notice by sending the notice by registered mail to your last known address. The 30-day period starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter. The notice will inform you that you have until noon of the business day before the last day of the notice period to pay the arrears, plus an administration fee, failing which the policy will automatically be cancelled effective at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the notice period. If you pay the arrears and the administration fee in time, then your policy will not be cancelled.

But if we have already given you two notices of non-payment of premium during the term of your policy and a non-payment occurs again, we don’t have to give you another notice under this section; instead we may cancel your policy as described in section 1.7.4.”

9.3.8.1.6.4 Section 1.7.4: How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-Payment or Other Reasons

“If we cancel your insurance for non-payment of premium because we have already given you two notices during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, or if we cancel for any other reason, we will notify you in writing. We must give you five days notice if we deliver the notice of cancellation in person, or 15 days notice by sending the notice of cancellation by registered mail to your last known address. The 15-day period starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter. If the notice was given because we have already given you two notices of non-payment during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, we are under no obligation to accept a late payment or to keep the policy in force after the effective date of cancellation.”

9.3.8.1.7 SECTION 1.8: WHO AND WHAT WE WON’T COVER

9.3.8.1.7.1 Section 1.8.1: General Exclusion

Section 1.8.1: General Exclusion states that the vehicle is not to be used to carry explosives or radioactive material, nor will it be used to carry paying passengers (that is, it won’t be used as a taxi or a bus). The definition of “paying passengers” does not include carpools, friends sharing costs, carrying domestic workers, carrying children for activities related to educational programs, carrying elderly or special needs passengers while volunteering within the community, or carrying current or prospective clients and/or customers.

The wording in this section begins with the phrase: “Except for certain Accident Benefits coverage, there is no coverage under this policy if…”. There are two very important points within this phrase. Sections 1.8.1: General Exclusion to 1.8.5: Losses Due to War Activities Not Covered list uses and drivers of the automobile that the policy does not cover.

Neither the driver’s potential legal liability, nor the potential damage to the vehicle itself, will be covered if any of these uses occur or if any of these excluded drivers operate the vehicle. These exclusions represent risks that the OAP 1 was never meant to insure. Coverage can be purchased to allow these activities, either through (1) endorsement and an additional premium or (2) a different insurance policy altogether.

While the vehicle and the operator’s liability are not covered if any of the listed activities take place, there is a provision to ensure that the party in breach of these contract conditions will still receive some coverage for medical expenses if there is an accident causing injury or death. We’ll cover this in Section 9.3.8.4: Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage. Aside from certain accident benefits coverages, there is no coverage, even for occupants in the vehicle, if the automobile is operated by a person without the owner’s consent or by a driver specifically excluded from this policy.

9.3.8.2 Section 2: What Automobiles Are Covered

Section 2: What Automobiles Are Covered explains coverages applicable to:

• Described automobiles.

• Extending the policy to other automobiles.

• When the insured has two or more automobiles.

• Trailers and towing.

• Inspection.

9.3.8.2.1 Section 2.1: Described Automobile

A described automobile is any automobile or trailer (or motorized snow vehicle, motorcycle, or ATV) specifically shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows which coverages were purchased for each described automobile. The coverages should include Section 3: Liability Coverage, Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage, Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage, Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage, and Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional).

9.3.8.2.2 Section 2.2: Extending Your Insurance to Other Automobiles

9.3.8.2.2.1 Section 2.2.1: Newly Acquired Automobiles

Newly acquired automobiles are either replacement automobiles (that is, a trade-in car) or additional automobiles (that is, a new car while keeping the old one). The new vehicle will have the same coverage as the vehicle it replaces, up to 14 days from the date it was purchased, provided the vehicle is not insured somewhere else. The 14-day window allows the insured enough time to arrange insurance on the new vehicle.

However, this time period is not free coverage. An endorsement needs to be processed to add the new vehicle, effective to the purchase date; this allows the insurer to collect for the coverage it is providing. This additional automobile extension can be a little difficult to understand, but there are two important points to know:

1) The policy states that, for any extension of coverage to apply, all the owned automobiles must be insured with the same insurer. The extension of coverage is an accommodation by the insurers for their insureds. If all vehicles are insured with one company, then it is a logical assumption that any new vehicle will also be insured with the same company. If vehicles are insured with more than one company, neither company will grant the extension, as there is no guarantee that the automobile will eventually be insured through them. If the business is not going to be placed with a particular insurer, the insurer will not grant the extension.

2) The policy states that the coverage provided under the automatic extension to an additional newly acquired automobile will be determined by the coverages in place on all owned automobiles. For example, for collision coverage to apply, collision coverage must be in place on all vehicles.

9.3.8.2.2.2 Section 2.2.2: Temporary Substitute Automobile

A “temporary substitute automobile” is defined as an automobile not owned by the insured or anyone else living in the insured’s dwelling that is temporarily used while the described automobile is out of service. The described automobile must be temporarily out of service due to breakdown, repair, servicing, theft, sale, or destruction.

The following coverages apply to a temporary substitute automobile, provided that a premium is shown for them on a Certificate of Automobile Insurance for the described automobile that is temporarily unavailable:

• Section 3: Liability Coverage.

• Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

• Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage.

If a premium is paid for physical damage coverages on the described automobile (found in all perils, collision, comprehensive or specified perils coverages), and the driver is involved in an accident while driving a temporary substitute automobile, the physical damage coverage will respond secondary to the coverage already in place on the vehicle (refer to Section 7.4.3: Temporary Substitute Automobile Covered).

Let’s look at an example:

Image

Dennis owns a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu and has it insured with $1,000,000 of liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, each with a $500 deductible. He needs to take it in for an oil change, so he borrows a car from his friend, Arif, for the afternoon.

Arif owns a 2019 Ford 150 truck. The Ford is also insured for $1,000,000, with collision and comprehensive coverage, although the deductibles on it are considerably higher (at $2,500 each). While driving the Ford, Dennis loses control and drives it into a tree at high speed.

The cost of a new fender and hood is approximately $18,000. Arif’s policy will pay for the damage first, as his policy is primary on the Ford. Arif will receive a cheque for $15,500 from his insurer, representing the $18,000 loss minus the $2,500 deductible.

Dennis could then claim $2,000 from his own insurer, as the Ford was a temporary substitute automobile in this case. His policy would pay Arif $2,000, representing the loss of $2,500 minus Dennis’s $500 deductible.

Note: A temporary substitute automobile cannot be owned by the insured or anyone living in the same dwelling as the insured.

9.3.8.2.2.3 Section 2.2.3: Other Automobiles

Automobiles other than the described automobile (that is, not the primary vehicle, but possibly a temporary substitute or newly acquired vehicle) are covered when driven by the insured or driven by their spouse, who lives with the insured.

The following coverage applies to other automobiles if a premium for it is shown on a Certificate of Automobile Insurance for a described automobile:

• Section 3: Liability Coverage.

• Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

• Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage.

Note: Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) are not available for other automobiles.

9.3.8.2.2.4 Section 2.2.4: Other Automobiles that Are Rented or Leased

Rented automobiles also fall within the definition of “other automobile.” This means it qualifies for the four legally required coverages, but only when the automobile is driven by the named insured or their spouse who lives with them.

The OAP 1 includes coverage for rented automobiles with a gross vehicle weight in excess of 4,500 kilograms, only if the rental is for personal use and rented for up to seven days. Rented automobiles with a gross vehicle weight of less than 4,500 kilograms have no time limit. This category of automobiles is specifically described to provide liability coverage when others drive automobiles rented or leased by the named insured with their permission.

If the driver is negligent in the operation of the vehicle, the insured is still protected against liability imposed by law upon them as the renter. This is a new addition to the OAP 1 as of January 2007, and it is now in place due to recent legislation changing the priority of policy coverage on rented or leased automobiles. You can find more information about this in Section 9.3.8.3: Section 3: Liability Coverage.

9.3.8.2.2.5 Section 2.2.5: Trailers

Any trailer used in connection with the described automobile is insured for the following coverages:

• Section 3: Liability Coverage.

• Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

• Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

Note that if the insured owns a trailer and it is not described in the policy, it would also be covered for Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage Coverage, provided (1) that it is attached to an automobile with a manufacturer’s gross weight rating of not more than 4,500 kilograms, or (2) that it is not attached to an automobile and is normally used with an automobile with a manufacturer’s gross weight rating of not more than 4,500 kilograms. In addition, it must not be designed or used for living in, for carrying passengers, or for commercial purposes.

9.3.8.2.3 Section 2.3: When You Have Two or More Automobiles Insured

When there are two automobiles insured under the same policy, each vehicle will be treated as if it were insured on a separate policy.

Let’s look at two examples.

First:

Image

Hannah owns two vehicles. Vehicle One is insured for $1,000,000 of liability, and Vehicle Two is insured for $500,000 of liability. Both are insured on the same policy. If Hannah were involved in an accident causing bodily injury or property damage to a third party, the limit of coverage would depend upon which car was involved. If Vehicle One were involved, she would be covered for up to $1,000,000 of damages. If Vehicle Two were involved, she would be covered for up to only $500,000 of damages.

If Hannah were involved in an accident while driving a vehicle she did not own, the unowned vehicle would be considered an “other automobile” by the policy’s definition, and she would be covered for up to $1,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party, the highest limit on her policy.

Second:

Image

Howard owns two vehicles. Vehicle One is insured for $1,000,000 of liability under a contract with ABC Insurance and Vehicle Two is insured for $500,000 of liability under a contract with XYZ Insurance.

If Howard were involved in an accident while driving a vehicle he did not own, the unowned vehicle would be considered an “other automobile” by both policies’ definitions, since both contracts are the OAP 1. Howard, like Hannah, would be covered for up to $1,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party, the highest single limit of liability insurance purchased by him on one vehicle.

However, the difficulty arises when determining how much each insurer, ABC and XYZ, should be forced to pay in the event of a loss. The policies state: “The amount we will pay under this policy for any incident will be a fraction of the highest policy limit. This fraction will be the proportion that the limit under this policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies.”

In this example, we have two policies: ABC’s contract covers $1,000,000 of liability, and XYZ’s contract covers $500,000. The total of liability limits in this case is $1,500,000. When the statement above is applied to ABC’s policy, ABC will pay the claim in the proportion that $1,000,000 bears to $1,500,000. The simplest way to think of this statement is to convert it to a fraction.

$1,000,000 ÷ $1,500,000 = 2/3 or 0.66

Therefore, ABC will pay 66% of the claim. or up to $666,666.66.

Applying the math to XYZ works in the same way:

$500,000 ÷ $1,500,000 = 1/3 or 0.33.

Therefore, XYZ will pay 33% of the claim, or up to $333,333.33.

9.3.8.2.4 Section 2.4: Trailers and Towing

“An automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when determining how much we will pay under Liability, Accident Benefits and Uninsured Automobile Coverages. However, they will be treated as separate automobiles when determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under Direct Compensation – Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage Coverages.”

9.3.8.2.5 Section 2.5: Inspection

“We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. If you do not co-operate inany reasonable arrangements for inspection, your optional Loss or Damage Coverages under Section 7 may be cancelled and any claims under that Section may be denied.”

9.3.8.3 Section 3: Liability Coverage

Section 3: Liability Coverage describes what the insurance company will cover if a third party is killed or injured in an accident or their property is damaged when the driver or other insured persons are involved in an at-fault accident.

This section describes in detail:

• Who is covered.

• What is covered.

• The insured’s and other insured persons’ responsibilities under the contract.

9.3.8.3.1 Section 3.2: Who is Covered?

The definition of “insured persons” under Section 3.2: Who is Covered? includes:

• The named insured.

• Anyone who, with permission of the named insured, personally drives the vehicle.

• Anyone who, with permission of the named insured, personally operates a part of the vehicle (for example, rolls down the window or opens the hood).

9.3.8.3.2 Section 3.3: What We Cover

Section 3.3: What We Cover is designed to provide coverage for liability imposed upon the named insured or other insured persons for bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party as a result of an automobile accident within Canada or the United States. The policy will make payments that the law requires on the named insured’s or other insured’s behalf, up to the limit of the policy.

It includes a provision for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses suffered by the insured for any immediate medical aid provided to any injured third parties involved in an accident. For example, if an insured is required to pay an ambulance fee or a fee for paramedic services or medical aid to someone else, the policy will pay back the insured for these costs. This amount is paid without affecting the limit of coverage purchased.

Once notification is given to the insurer that a third-party loss has occurred, the insurer will investigate, negotiate with the injured party, and make a settlement of the claim on behalf of the insured. The limit of liability purchased is reserved specifically to compensate third parties for property damage or bodily injury caused by the actions of the insured.

9.3.8.3.2.1 Section 3.3.1: If Someone Sues You

By purchasing the policy, the insured agrees that, if someone presses a lawsuit against them in Canada or the United States, the insurance company will provide the insured’s legal representation — the policy states “you or other insured persons irrevocably appoint us to act on your or their behalf.” The insured must be represented by the insurer; they cannot appoint their own legal representative. The insurer agrees to pay all costs associated with the defence of the suit, including any investigation costs appropriate, court costs levied against the insured, and any post-judgment interest accruing on that portion of the judgment that is within the limit of liability purchased.

If the lawsuit is for an amount greater than the limit of insurance purchased, the insured may appoint a legal representative to defend against the amount of the suit exceeding the policy limit.

9.3.8.3.2.2 Section 3.3.2: How Much We Will Pay

Section 3.3.2: How Much We Will Pay uses an example to illustrate some of the payment provisions explained in Section 3.3.1: If Someone Sues You.

Let’s look at another example.

Image

Tonya was involved in an accident. She lost control of her vehicle and slid on black ice into the back of the car in front of her. After coming to a stop, she realized the driver of that car had hit their head on their steering wheel. She called an ambulance and was later billed $250 for paramedic emergency response. The other driver suffered a permanent, serious disfigurement to their face, and as a result, they filed a lawsuit against Tonya for $1,500,000.

Tonya is insured under an OAP 1 for $1,000,000 of liability. Tonya’s insurer will pay the $250 bill for emergency medical aid on her behalf. Her insurer will then investigate the accident, negotiate with the injured third party, and may attempt to make a settlement out of court with them. If the suit proceeds, the insurer will appoint Tonya a legal representative and defend her against the suit. The insurer will pay all costs for the lawyer appointed to Tonya, the defence cost, and any investigation costs incurred by the insurer.

If Tonya loses the suit, she would have to pay the court costs (usually around $10,000 to $15,000). In her case, the insurer will cover the court costs, and $1,000,000 of the settlement, since that was the amount of insurance purchased. Tonya will be responsible for the remaining $500,000. The insurer will pay post-judgment interest on the portion of the loss insured (in this case, $1,000,000). Tonya will be responsible for the interest on the $500,000 not covered.

9.3.8.3.2.3 Section 3.3.3: Outside Ontario

Section 3.3.3: Outside Ontario states that “If the incident happens in a jurisdiction covered by this policy in which the minimum liability coverage required is higher than the limit shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we will honour the higher amount.” The “minimum limit” referenced here is the lowest amount of legal liability coverage that must be purchased in any jurisdiction. In Canada, insureds must carry at least $200,000 of liability insurance in all common law provinces. In Quebec, insureds must carry $50,000.

If an insured has insured their vehicle to the minimum limit required, the policy will honour the minimum limit in any jurisdiction where coverage is afforded (that is, in Canada and the United States).

Let’s look at an example.

Tinh insured his vehicle for $200,000 of liability on an OAP 1 in January. The province of Nova Scotia has raised their minimum limit to $500,000 for automobile liability insurance. If Tinh took a vacation in Nova Scotia and was subsequently sued for causing an automobile accident there, his Ontario OAP 1 would honour the higher minimum limits in Nova Scotia.

In effect, the minute that Tinh drove over the Nova Scotia border, his Ontario liability increased to the limits required in Nova Scotia.

9.3.8.3.2.4 Section 3.3.4: If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy

Section 3.3.4: If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy explains how insureds under the same policy are protected against lawsuits from each other. Each insured will be treated as if a separate policy had been issued for each of them. However, the maximum amount payable for any one incident will be their purchased liability limit, split between them — not the maximum limit for each insured.

9.3.8.3.2.5 Section 3.3.5: Rented and Leased Automobiles

The OAP 1 provides a special extension of liability to protect the insured against liability imposed due to the negligent operation of a rented or leased automobile by another driver. In 2007, legislation in Ontario changed the order in which different insurance policies covering these rented and leased automobiles should pay if the automobile is involved in an accident causing bodily injury or property damage.

A rented vehicle is covered by both the renter’s OAP 1 and the fleet policy of the company that owns the vehicle being rented. Take Hertz, for example — it has a policy insuring all its automobiles, which means it provides liability insurance for all drivers who rent their vehicles. This legislation makes the renter’s liability coverage respond before the rental car company’s policy will respond. If the renter allows another person to drive the rented vehicle, the renter’s policy responds first, the driver’s policy (if applicable) responds second, and the rental car company’s policy responds third. In all cases, the rental car company’s policy is the last to pay.

Leased vehicles are also subject to this same priority of payment legislation for liability claims. For example, if you lease a vehicle from Honda Financial Services, it will also have an insurance policy covering the leased vehicle. While the lessee’s policy (the OAP 1) is primary, the leasing company will always have a contingent policy to cover the car in case, for some reason, the policy of the lessee does not respond to provide coverage when needed. The leasing company’s policy on a vehicle will always be the last policy called upon to respond to any liability claims brought forward.

Section 3.3.5: Rented and Leased Automobiles offers two examples of how the OAP 1 would respond if a rental car were involved in an accident for which the driver was found to be negligent. In one instance, the renter is driving the vehicle; in the other instance, a friend of the renter is driving the vehicle. In both cases, the rental car company’s insurance policy responds last to the liability claim.

It is also important to note that the rental car company’s insurance limit is provided on a contingent basis only.

Let’s look at an example:

Amelia is going to rent a car from Best Rentals. Best Rentals’s policy has a liability limit of $1,000,000. If Amelia has no automobile of her own (and therefore no OAP 1), then Best Rentals’s policy would respond up to the limit of their coverage to protect Amelia from liability claims.

If Amelia does own her own car (and therefore does have an OAP 1), then Best Rentals’s policy will respond, but only to top up Amelia’s own OAP 1 liability limit to the limit on Best Rentals’s policy. If Amelia has $200,000 of liability coverage under her own OAP 1 policy, this coverage would respond first to any claims, and if exhausted, then Best Rentals’s coverage would step in to pay claims over and above, but only up to the limit of their policy.

9.3.8.3.3 Section 3.4: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities

Section 3.4: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities contains five points, plus a final paragraph in bold letters. Each is a Statutory Condition that the insured must fulfill in order to receive the coverage.

1) The insured must notify the insurer in writing within seven days of any incident involving the loss or damage to persons or property, giving the insurer full details of the incident and the claim arising from it. This is based on Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property, which we will look at later.

2) The insured must make a statutory declaration (sworn affidavit) that the insured or other insured persons were driving the vehicle at the time of the loss. Since the insurer is liable for a potentially very large sum of money on the insured’s behalf, they expect a statement advising the insurer that either the named insured, or somebody with the named insured’s express permission to use the automobile, was involved in the accident. Anybody else driving the automobile at the time of the accident would receive no coverage.

3) The insured must co-operate with all investigative procedures as would be reasonable. Insureds are required to provide information of witnesses to the scene and co-operate in any legal action by the insurer if they ask.

4) The insured must forward any and all legal correspondence received regarding a legal action immediately to the insurer. The insurer is the insured’s irrevocable legal counsel — it’s their responsibility to act upon it.

5) The insured must not assume or admit liability for the incident or try to amicably settle the claim, except at the insured’s own cost. From the insurer’s perspective, this is very important. Admitting liability makes it almost impossible for the insurer to create a defence against any legal action that may follow. Since the insurer is potentially liable for the policy limit to the third party, any admission of responsibility to the third party could be very costly. The insured is also not allowed to interfere with any negotiations towards any settlement by the insurer.

6) Most importantly, the bold final paragraph refers to the absolute liability provision of law. If the insurer has to pay a sum of money due to a provision of law, and the payment was not made under the terms of the policy agreements, the insured is required to repay the insurer all amounts paid to a third party. See Section 9.3.8.3.6: Absolute Liability.

9.3.8.3.4 Summary of Sections 3.3 and 3.4

We’ve covered a lot, so let’s do a quick review. Under Section 3.3: What We Cover, an insurer agrees:

• To investigate, negotiate, and settle claims.

• To pay any amounts the insured is liable for, up to the policy limit.

• To pay out-of-pocket expenses for immediate medical aid.

• To pay defence costs if a suit is brought against the insured.

• To pay court costs assessed against the insured.

• To pay any post-judgment interest accruing on the part of the settlement within the policy limits.

Under Section 3.4: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities, the insured agrees:

• To notify the insurer in writing within seven days of any incident involving bodily injury or property damage to a third party.

• To make a statutory declaration that they, or other insured persons, were operating the vehicle at the time of loss.

• To help the insurer obtain information and co-operate with the insurer in any legal action.

• To forward immediately everything received in writing regarding the claim, including legal documents.

• Not to assume or admit liability.

• Repay the insurer for any amounts it was forced to pay through the absolute liability provision.

9.3.8.3.5 SECTION 3.5: OTHER LIMITATIONS ON YOUR COVERAGE

9.3.8.3.5.1 Section 3.5.1: Property Not Covered

Liability insurance is reserved solely to compensate others for property damage or bodily injury caused by the insured. This provision ensures the limit purchased is not used to pay for the insured’s own property or property the insured is responsible for. For example, if the insured strikes their own house with the automobile, liability coverage would not apply. However, the insured’s property policy would respond to such claims for damage.

9.3.8.3.5.2 Section 3.5.2: Contamination of Property

There is no coverage under the policy for property contaminated due to being carried in the automobile.

9.3.8.3.5.3 Section 3.5.3: Nuclear Hazards

There is no coverage under the OAP 1 for liability caused by nuclear hazards, unless the insured also has a nuclear energy hazard liability policy. The coverage, if provided, is limited to $200,000 regardless of the liability amount purchased and is excess to this other policy only.

9.3.8.3.6 Absolute Liability

Each province’s Insurance Act contains clauses commonly referred to as the absolute liability provision. Absolute liability is designed to protect innocent third parties when a policyholder has violated a term or condition of their contract and, as a consequence, voided their policy. It allows the injured third party access to the money under an insurance contract regardless of any act or breach of the policy by the insured.

The injured party’s right to recover the insurance money payable under the policy shall not be prejudiced by:

• Any assignment, waiver, surrender, cancellation, or discharge of the policy by the insured after the event giving rise to the claim.

• Any act or default of the insured before or after the event in violation of the Insurance Act or the policy.

• Any violation of the Criminal Code of Canada or statute of any province by the owner or driver of the automobile.

9.3.8.3.7 Laws Restricting Legal Actions for Automobile Accidents in Ontario

9.3.8.3.7.1 Tort Provisions
Requirements and details for torts: Bill 59 (1996), Bill 198 (2002), Bill 5 (2003), including Ontario Regulation 34/10 (2010)

9.3.8.3.7.2 Limitation Period

Civil proceedings to recover damages for injuries arising from a motor vehicle accident must be started within two years of the incident. Any court proceeding used to enforce the entitlement of coverages available according to the SABS must be started within two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the claimed benefit.

9.3.8.3.7.3 Tort Framework Recovery for Pecuniary (Economic) Losses

Effective November 1, 1996, the right to sue for economic losses was reinstated for all accident victims who were not at fault in causing an accident and who suffered a loss to either income or earning capacity due to bodily injuries, or death, while using or operating the automobile.

The innocent party can recover damages for income loss and loss of capacity from the tortfeasor. However, this amount will be a maximum of 70% of gross income from the period commencing seven days after the accident up to and including the date of trial. An innocent party will not be entitled to claim damages against at-fault parties for any damages suffered in the first seven days after the accident. After the trial, the innocent party will be entitled to recover damages on a 100% gross basis for future economic losses from the tort-feasor.

9.3.8.3.7.4 Non-Pecuniary (Non-Economic) Losses

When someone files a claim that is a non-pecuniary loss due to a motor vehicle accident, or even by the use or operation of an automobile, any fatal injury or injury that meets the threshold (as described below) can be counted as a non-pecuniary loss.

9.3.8.3.7.4.1 Threshold

In a threshold-based system, people are prohibited from taking legal action until a certain point has been passed. There are two common types of thresholds: monetary and verbal.

Under the OAP 1, the threshold indicates the degree of severity of an injury caused in an automobile accident in Ontario to enable the injured party to bring an action (known as a tort) against the at-fault party who caused their injuries. In simpler terms, the policyholders must be harmed “at least this much” to sue for their injuries.

To meet the threshold, the injured person must be able to show that they have:

• Died.

• Suffered a permanent, serious disfigurement.

• Suffered a permanent, serious impairment of an important physical, mental, or psychological function.

The individual is then entitled to commence a civil proceeding for the recovery of non-pecuniary losses (also known as “pain and suffering”), provided that the individual was not at fault and falls into one of the following categories:

• The individual was the owner of the automobile.

• The individual was an occupant of the automobile.

• The individual was present at the incident.

9.3.8.3.7.4.2 Deductibles for Non-Pecuniary Awards

As of October 1, 2003, a plaintiff who obtains a judgment or a settlement for non-pecuniary loss must pay a deductible on the current non-economic loss settlement. As you learned earlier, the Government of Ontario updates this deductible dollar amount from time to time. This deductible applies to each person included in the award. An exception to the per person deductible exists in the Family Law Act, Section 61(2)(e). This will reduce the deductible (this amount is also updated by the Government of Ontario from time to time) per person for suits pertaining to the loss of a parent or guardian, or “loss of care, guidance or companionship” claims.

For example, if a legal couple wins a $1,000,000 settlement, then each person pays the deductible. For the current year’s deductible, see the Ontario Auto Brochure:

https://www.ibao.org/materials/ontario-auto/.

9.3.8.3.7.4.3 Motion to Determine if Non-Pecuniary Threshold Has Been Met

Either a plaintiff or an insurer, on consent, can make a motion in a trial to determine if the verbal threshold for non-pecuniary loss has been satisfied. In addition, a judge may make an order to determine whether the threshold has been met, even if set out in the pretrial conference. An order made by a judge on a motion is binding on all parties at trial.

9.3.8.3.7.4.4 Motion to Determine if Health Care Expenses Threshold Has Been Met

Either a plaintiff or an insurer defending a claim may make a motion on consent to determine whether an injury meets the definition of “catastrophic impairment” before the trial. Conversely, a judge may determine whether the threshold has been met before the trial, if it is set out in an order by a judge who conducts the pretrial conference.

Catastrophic impairment includes:

• Paraplegia or quadriplegia.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both arms.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both an arm and a leg.

• Total loss of vision in both eyes.

• Brain impairment as defined by the rating system approved by Insurance Act and SABS regulations.

• Any impairment or combination of impairments that result in 55% or more impairment of the whole person according to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.

• A mental or behavioural impairment that creates a marked or extreme impairment. The impairment must preclude useful functioning.

Note: Since Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage is designed to cover all health care expenses sustained by the insured, there is no requirement to allow for the recovery of such expenses through tort proceedings unless the injured party has sustained a catastrophic impairment. Due to the severe nature of catastrophic impairment, it is very likely that some injuries could totally exhaust the limit provided in the medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care coverage in Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage. This is a key area of insurance that the general public is unaware of, and brokers can help explain it to them.

9.3.8.3.7.5 Uninsured Owner or Lessee Precluded from Commencing Civil Proceedings

An injured individual is precluded from commencing a civil proceeding to recover damages for personal injury or economic loss arising from a motor vehicle accident when the vehicle was uninsured. This rule applies whether they were an owner or lessee of an automobile at the time of the accident and was operating it, or if they were an occupant in their own vehicle at the time of the accident.

To further deter owners from driving without prerequisite insurance, the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act was amended to substantially increase the fines for driving without insurance. Upon conviction, for a first offence, fines will range between $5,000 and $25,000; upon a subsequent conviction, fines will range from $10,000 to $50,000.

9.3.8.4 Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage

As of June 1, 2016, the SABS was amended through the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability Act (Bill 59). This act and its amendments set the basic limits to the statutory accident benefits for injured individuals.

Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage explains:

• Who is covered.

• Types and benefits.

• How to apply for benefits.

• Limitations on coverage.

All insureds have the option of purchasing additional coverage in the following categories:

• Income replacement.

• Caregiver benefit.

• Dependant care benefit.

• Medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care.

• Death and funeral benefit.

• Indexation of benefits payable.

The process requires insurers to advise applicants of coverages and categories that they are entitled to apply for. Every effort must be made to ensure that the public is fully aware of the protection afforded by the OAP 1.

Let’s look at the basic accident scenarios under Ontario’s no-fault insurance rules when different types of accidents require accident benefits to respond.

1) At fault with both parties insured: Non-catastrophic injuries

Image

When an accident doesn’t involve catastrophic injuries, each person’s insurance will respond, regardless of fault. Accident benefits are covered by each person’s insurer (note that the arrows point away from the other party).

2) At fault with both parties insured: Catastrophic injuries

Image

When an accident involves catastrophic injuries, here is how the claims process works:

1) At-fault party seeks Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage from their insurer.

2) Not-at-fault party first seeks Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage from their insurer.

3) Not-at-fault party then sues at-fault party’s Section 3: Liability Coverage for residual damage not covered under their own Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

9.3.8.4.1 Section 4.1: Who is Covered?

For accidents which occur in Ontario involving the described automobile (or other insured automobile), “insured person” means:

• The named insured, their spouse, and the dependants of either spouse.

• Persons specified as operators of the automobile or listed as drivers in the policy.

• Any other person involved in an accident involving the insured automobile, if they cannot access their own statutory accident benefits (that is, if they do not own a vehicle or have no insurance).

For accidents which occur outside of Ontario, “insured person” means:

• The named insured, their spouse, and the dependants of either spouse.

• A person who is an occupant of the insured automobile and who is a resident of Ontario or was a resident of Ontario at some point during the 60 days before the accident.

Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage includes coverage for the named insured, their spouse, and any dependant of either who is not involved in the accident, but who suffers psychological or mental injury as a result of an accident causing physical injuries to defined family members.

Since there is usually more than one vehicle involved in an automobile accident, there are priority of payment rules to prevent injured insureds from claiming from multiple policies for their injuries. Claimants for accident benefits must claim based on the priority of payments schedule below:

1) Injured persons claim from their own/their spouse’s insurer.

2) If no insurance exists, injured parties claim from the insurer of the vehicle in which they were an occupant at the time of the accident.

3) If no insurance exists there, injured parties claim from the insurer of any other vehicle involved in the accident.

4) If no vehicles involved in the accident are insured, injured parties can claim for their injuries from the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (MVACF).29

9.3.8.4.2 Section 4.2: Types and Benefits

9.3.8.4.2.1 Income Replacement Benefit

Income replacement benefit is available to a person (named insured or not) who sustains impairment as a result of an accident and satisfies one of the following two criteria:

1) They were employed at the time of the accident, and as a result of the accident, and within 104 weeks of the accident, suffer a substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of that employment.

2) They were unemployed at the time of the accident; however:

a) They were employed for at least 26 weeks during the 52-week period or were receiving benefits under the Employment Insurance Act;

b) They were 16 years of age or more or were excused from attendance at school under the Education Act at the time of the accident; and

c) As a result of and within 104 weeks after the accident, they suffer a substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of the employment in which they spent the most time during the 52 weeks before the accident.

The insurer is not required to pay an income replacement benefit:

• For the first seven days of disability.

• For any period longer than 104 weeks of disability, unless an injured person, as a result of the accident, can demonstrate that they are suffering from a complete inability to engage in any employment by which they are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. If the insured person qualifies for the benefits pursuant to a written contract as noted above, the insurer does not have to pay the benefit for the period before the day they would have been entitled to commence employment pursuant to the contract.

The amount of the income replacement benefit will be calculated as follows:

• For the first 104 weeks of disability, the insured is entitled to 70% of their gross weekly income from employment. An individual’s net weekly income is equal to their gross weekly income minus the premium payable under the Employment Insurance Act of Canada, the contribution payable under the Canada Pension Plan, and the income tax payable under the Income Tax Act of Canada and the Income Tax Act of Ontario. The maximum payable under the SABS is $400 a week.

• For each week after the first 104 weeks of disability, the insured is entitled to the greater of (1) the amount specified in the above paragraph or (2) $185.

All payments made under Section 4: Accidents Benefits Coverage shall be reduced by amounts equal to:

• Net weekly payments for loss of income that have been received by the person as a result of an accident under the laws of any jurisdiction or under any income continuation plan.

• Net weekly payments for loss of income that are not being received by the person, but are available to the person as a result of an accident under the laws of any jurisdiction or under any income continuation plan, unless the person has applied to receive payments for loss of income.

However, the following will not reduce the basic income replacement benefit:

• Benefits under the Employment Insurance Act.

• Benefits under a sick leave plan that are not being received by the person, but are available to the person.

• Payments under any workers’ compensation plan which the person is not entitled to receive because the person has elected to bring an action against the responsible third party.

Note that the income replacement benefit can exceed the 104-week period if the disability extends beyond 104 weeks since the date of the accident. In these situations, the eligibility criteria for receiving the benefit are elevated as follows:

• From the date of accident up to 104 weeks, does the insured have substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of the primary employment?

• Past 104 weeks, does the insured have complete inability to engage in any employment for which they are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience?

If the courts adopt a conservative interpretation of “complete inability” to engage in any employment for which an insured is reasonably suited by education, training, or experience, it would be very difficult for the insured to obtain benefits past the 104-week period.

9.3.8.4.2.1.1 Self-Employment

A self-employed person (named insured or not) will receive 70% of their gross income loss, as reported to Revenue Canada at the end of the previous tax season. A self-employed person’s weekly income or loss from self-employment at the time of the accident is the amount that would be 1/52 of their income or loss from the business for the last completed taxation year as determined by the Income Tax Act.

9.3.8.4.2.1.2 Cost of Report

If an accountant is hired to prepare the application for the income replacement benefit, the insurer will contribute a maximum of $2,500 for the preparation of one or more reports for the purpose of determining an insured person’s entitlement to an income replacement benefit.

9.3.8.4.2.1.3 Non-Earner Benefit

For a person (named insured or not) to be entitled to the non-earner benefit, they must meet the following criteria:

• The impairment must completely preclude them from carrying on a normal life within the 104 weeks after the accident.

• They must not be eligible for any income replacement benefits.

• They suffer impairment as a result of the motor vehicle accident.

• If they received a caregiver benefit, there is no longer a person in need of care.

In addition, if they meet the above criteria and were enrolled on a full-time basis in elementary, secondary, or post-secondary education at the time of the accident or completed their education less than a year before the accident, the person may be eligible to receive this benefit.

The non-earner benefit is not payable for the first four weeks after the accident. Once it becomes payable, the non-earner benefit provides $185 for each week the person continues to satisfy the criteria. This coverage is available for two years after the date of the accident.

9.3.8.4.2.2 Caregiver Benefit

A person (named insured or not) is entitled to the caregiver benefit if they sustain a catastrophic impairment as a result of a motor vehicle accident and:

• Resided with a person in need of care;

• Were the primary caregiver for the person in need of care; and

• Did not receive any remuneration for performing the caregiving activities.

The caregiver must, within 104 weeks of the date of the accident, be substantially unable to engage in the caregiving activities which were performed at the time of the accident.

Although the insurer is obligated to compensate an individual for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred, the insurer will only be responsible for a maximum of $250 per week for the first person in need of care, and a maximum of $50 per week for each additional person in need of care.

After the first 104 weeks of disability, an insurer is no longer obligated to continue payment of the caregiver benefit unless a claimant can demonstrate that, as a result of the accident, they suffered a complete inability to carry on a normal life. The caregiver benefit can be added by endorsement and additional premium for non-catastrophic injuries.

9.3.8.4.2.3 Medical, Rehabilitation, and Attendant Care Benefits

9.3.8.4.2.3.1 Medical Benefit

The medical benefit pays for all reasonable medical expenses incurred which are not covered under another insurance plan or provincial health care plan. Expenses recoverable include:

• Medical, surgical, dental, optometric, hospital, nursing, ambulance, audiometric, and speech language pathology services.

• Chiropractic, psychological, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy services.

• Medication.

• Prescription eyewear.

• Dentures and other dental devices.

• Hearing aids, wheelchairs, and other mobility devices, prosthesis, orthotics, and other assistive devices.

• Transportation for the insured person to and from treatment sessions, including transportation for an aide or attendant.

• Other goods and services of a medical nature that the insured person requires.

9.3.8.4.2.3.2 Rehabilitation Benefit

The rehabilitation benefit covers not only the medical rehabilitation costs from an accident, but also the social rehabilitation costs associated with retraining and re-education. Examples of these expenses are:

• Life skills training.

• Family counselling.

• Social rehabilitation counselling.

• Financial counselling.

• Employment counselling.

• Vocational assessments.

• Vocational or academic training.

• Workplace modifications and workplace devices, including communication aids, to accommodate the needs of the insured person.

• Home modifications and home devices, including communication aids, to accommodate the needs of the insured person, or the purchase of a new home if it is more reasonable to purchase a new home to accommodate the needs of the insured person than to renovate their existing home.

• Vehicle modifications to accommodate the needs of the insured person, or the purchase of a new vehicle if it is more reasonable to purchase a new vehicle to accommodate the needs of the insured person than to modify their existing vehicle.

• Transportation for the insured person to and from counselling sessions, training sessions, and assessments, including transportation for an aide or attendant.

• Other goods and services that the insured person requires, except services provided by a case manager.

9.3.8.4.2.3.3 Attendant Care Benefit

The attendant care benefit reimburses an attendant to look after the insured either at home or within a health care facility.

Note: For more information about time limits on benefits, see Section 20 of the SABS.

9.3.8.4.2.3.4 Maximum Basic Limits on Medical, Rehabilitation, and Attendant Care Benefits

For minor injuries, the insurer is not obligated to pay more than $3,500 in medical and rehabilitation benefits and assessments, and there are no payments made for attendant care. If the injury is non-minor/non catastrophic, the insurer will pay a maximum of $65,000 for medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits, combined. If the injury is catastrophic, the insurer will pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for all medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits, combined.

Transportation expenses to and from treatment sessions will be paid in accordance with the Transportation Expense Schedule created by the Ontario Insurance Commission (now under the FSRA). If the insured uses their own vehicle to commute back and forth to treatment sessions, they cannot claim reimbursement of expenses for the first 50 kilometres per visit, per round trip.

9.3.8.4.2.4 Death and Funeral Benefits

The insurer must pay all funeral expenses incurred, to a maximum of $6,000, for the death of an insured.

If an insured person dies within 180 days of an automobile accident, or within 156 weeks of the accident if the person was continuously disabled as a result of the accident, the insurer will pay $25,000 to their spouse and $10,000 to each of the insured’s dependants. To each person to whom the insured person had an obligation to provide support under a court order or domestic contract, the insurer will pay $10,000. If the insured person did not have a spouse at the time of their death, the insurer is obligated to pay the $25,000 spousal entitlement to any legal dependant, over and above the $10,000 already paid to them. If there is more than one dependant, the sum is shared equally between them. If the deceased was a dependant, $10,000 will be paid to the person depended upon (for example, their parents or guardian).

In addition, if the insured was obligated by a domestic contract or a court order to make payments to a former spouse at the time of their death, the former spouse is entitled to receive a payment of $10,000 from the insurer.

For any of the individuals noted above to become entitled to the payments as outlined, they must survive the insured person by at least 30 days. If there are no surviving dependants, there will be no death benefit.

9.3.8.4.2.5 Other Expenses Covered

9.3.8.4.2.5.1 Lost Educational Expenses

If the insured was enrolled in an elementary, secondary, post-secondary, or continuing education program at the time of the accident, and they are unable to continue the educational program as a consequence of the accident and an ensuing impairment, the insurer is liable to reimburse the insured up to $15,000.

The term “educational expenses” includes expenses incurred for the following items before the date of the accident:

• Tuition.

• Books.

• Equipment or room and board associated with the educational program, provided that these expenses have a reasonable connection to the educational programs in which the insured has been precluded from attending as a result of the accident.

9.3.8.4.2.5.2 Visitor Expenses

If an insured suffers impairment as a result of an accident, the insurer is obligated to pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by any individual as designated in Section 22(1) of the SABS who visits the insured person during their treatment or subsequent recovery. Unless the insured person has suffered a catastrophic impairment, the insurer is only obligated to pay expenses under this category up to 104 weeks from the date of the accident.

9.3.8.4.2.5.3 Housekeeping and Home Maintenance

If, as a result of an accident, the insured suffers a catastrophic impairment that renders them substantially incapable of performing housekeeping and home maintenance activities that they customarily engaged in before the accident, the insurer is liable to reimburse the insured for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred.

The maximum amount that an insurer is obligated to pay under the housekeeping and home maintenance expense category is $100 per week. In addition, unless the insured has suffered a catastrophic injury, the insurer is not required to make any payment for expenses incurred more than 104 weeks after the onset of the compensable disability. Coverage for housekeeping and home maintenance for non-catastrophic injuries can be added by endorsement and for an additional premium.

9.3.8.4.2.5.4 Damage to Clothing, Glasses, Hearing Aids, etc.

If claims for expenses under this category are reasonable and were incurred as a direct result of the motor vehicle accident by the insured or an individual on their behalf, an insurer is obligated to provide compensation for the repair or replacement of the miscellaneous articles logically falling within this category.

9.3.8.4.2.5.5 Cost of Examinations

The insurer will pay reasonable expenses on behalf of an insured person for assessments, reports, and fees of a health practitioner (including approving treatment plans) pursuant to the provisions of the SABS. The maximum an insurer will pay is $2,000 for fees for any one assessment or examination. The insurer will not pay for fees for preparing a future plan, a life care plan, or any assessment or examination conducted in connection with the preparation of the plan.

9.3.8.4.2.6 Optional Benefits

Insurers are obligated to inform all applicants about the following optional benefits.

• Optional income replacement benefits: The insured has an option of selecting the sum of $600, $800, or $1,000 as the maximum amount of an income replacement benefit. The provision maximizing the benefit to 70% of the insured’s gross weekly income will remain.

• Optional caregiver, housekeeping, and home maintenance benefits: The insured can elect to amend the basic coverage to have these benefits apply to a non-catastrophic injury.

The following conditions apply:

- The optional benefit applies if the insured person suffers a substantial inability to engage in caregiving activities in which they were engaged at the time of the accident.

- The optional benefit is limited to 104 weeks of disability unless, as a result of the accident, the insured person suffers a complete inability to carry on a normal life.

- The housekeeping and home maintenance benefit does not apply for expenses incurred more than 104 weeks after the onset of the disability.

- The optional benefit does not increase the weekly benefits as indicated in the basic caregiver benefit and housekeeping and home maintenance benefit.

• Optional dependant care benefit: The insurer will pay for reasonable and necessary additional expenses incurred by or on behalf of an insured person in caring for the insured person’s dependants, if:

- The insured person sustained impairment as a result of the accident.

- The insured person was employed at the time of the accident.

- The insured person is not receiving a caregiver benefit.

The dependant care benefit will pay up to $75 per week for the first dependant and $25 per week for each additional dependant, to a maximum of $150 per week.

• Optional combined medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefit: The non-catastrophic injuries basic benefit pays up to $65,000, with a five-year time limit. The non-catastrophic impairment coverage can be doubled up to $130,000. If the insured is catastrophically impaired, the basic benefit pays $1,000,000 for combined expenses. The insured can increase this up to $2,000,000. If the insured chooses to purchase these coverages, it will also increase the payment period from five to 10 years. Here, the insured has the option to increase medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefit for catastrophic impairment and all injuries up to a combined total of $2,000,000.

• Increased death and funeral benefit: The basic level of death benefit paid to the surviving spouse ($25,000) and dependant ($10,000) of a person who is killed can be doubled by purchasing this optional coverage. This coverage also increases the basic funeral expense benefit from $6,000 to $8,000.

• Optional indexation benefit: Indexation is commonly considered a cost of living adjustment to benefits, subject to weekly or monthly limits. If the indexation benefit is selected, the indexation will be applied on January 1 of every year following the accident by adjusting the amount payable under the benefit by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Canada, as published by Statistics Canada under the authority of the Statistics Act. This benefit does not apply to the death and funeral benefit.

9.3.8.4.3 Section 4.3: How to Apply for Benefits

9.3.8.4.3.1 Section 4.3.1: Applying for Benefits — Procedures and Time Limits

Section 32(1) of the SABS stipulates that an individual who wants to apply for a benefit should notify the insurer within seven days of the accident. Once notified, the insurer must quickly provide the correct application and a written explanation of the benefits the insured may be entitled to. Upon receiving the application, the insured is expected to submit the application to the insurer within 30 days. If the insurer requires any further information to determine if the insured is entitled to benefits or not, the insured must provide the additional information within 14 days of receiving the request.

9.3.8.4.3.2 Method of Payment for Income Replacement, Non-Earner or Caregiver Benefits

Once the insurer determines the individual is entitled to the identified benefits, they are expected to make the first payment within 14 days after receiving the application. However, if the insurer determines that the individual is not entitled to, or is no longer entitled to, receive income replacement, non-earner, or caregiver benefits, the insurer must provide the insured notice of their determinations, including written reasons, within 14 days after receiving the initial application for benefits (or if an insurer has been paying the benefits, no later than the date the next benefit payment is due).

If an insured has been receiving income replacement, non-earner, or caregiver benefits, upon receiving notice that the insurer has determined to discontinue the benefit, the insured has the right to require an assessment pursuant to Section 47 of the SABS by giving the insurer written notice before the date listed as the terminal (end) date of the benefit. Once the insurer receives this request for an assessment, the insurer is no longer entitled to stop payment of the benefits until they receive a medical assessment.

There are additional reporting procedures for other accident benefits that we won’t describe here — see Sections 38 to 49 of the SABS.

9.3.8.4.3.3 Limitation Period

Any initial proceedings (that is, court or arbitration proceedings) under the Insurance Act regarding these regulated benefits must be commenced within two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the amount that was claimed.

9.3.8.4.3.4 Minor Injury Guideline

On September 1, 2010, the SABS was updated to include a Minor Injury Guideline.

Under the Minor Injury Guideline, the maximum that will be paid for medical and rehabilitation benefits for a predominantly minor injury shall not exceed $3,500. This limitation will not apply to an insured person if their health practitioner determines and provides compelling evidence that the insured person has a pre-existing medical condition that will prevent them from achieving maximal recovery from the minor injury.

Examples of minor injuries include:

• A sprain.

• A strain.

• Whiplash-associated disorders.

• A contusion.

• An abrasion.

• A laceration or subluxation.

• Any clinically associated sequelae.

The Minor Injury Guideline sets the allowable fees for the initial treatment blocks for continuing treatments, health practitioner monitoring, completion of the Minor Injury Discharge Report (OCF- 24), supplementary goods and services, and X-ray fees.

9.3.8.4.3.5 Recovery of Health Care Expenses for Catastrophic Impairment

When a plaintiff, who is not at fault and has suffered an injury, incurs expenses for health care as a result of an injury directly or indirectly caused by the use or operation of the motor vehicle, they will be entitled to recover damages for health care expenses if the injury meets the verbal threshold of catastrophic impairment.

As we learned from Section 9.3.8.3.7.4.4: Motion to Determine if Health Care Expenses Threshold Has Been Met, catastrophic impairment includes:

• Paraplegia or quadriplegia.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both arms.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both an arm and a leg.

• Total loss of vision in both eyes.

• Brain impairment, as defined by the rating system approved by the Insurance Act and SABS regulations.

• Any impairment or combination of impairments that result in 55% or more impairment of the whole person according to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.

• A mental or behavioural impairment that creates a marked or extreme impairment. This impairment must preclude useful functioning.

9.3.8.4.3.6 Deduction for Collateral Source Benefits from Recovery of Health Care Expenses

Recovered health expenses will be reduced by the following amounts:

• All payments available before the trial of the action for statutory accident benefits in respect of the expenses for health care.

• All payments received before the trial of the action under any medical, surgical, dental, hospitalization, rehabilitation, or long-term care plan.

Note: All future collateral source health care benefits must be held in trust and disbursed to those from whom damages were recovered in the action in proportion to the amount those persons paid in damages.

9.3.8.4.3.7 Limitations

Entitlement to income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits, or compensation for other expenses may be reduced or eliminated if an insured is responsible for any of the following infractions:

• Knew or should reasonably have known that they were operating an automobile without insurance. Driving an automobile while not authorized by law to drive.

• Driving an automobile they were specifically excluded from driving under the policy.

• Knowingly operated or should reasonably have known that the automobile was operated without the owner’s consent.

• Made or knew about a material misrepresentation that induced the insurer to issue the policy.

• Intentionally failed to notify the insurer of any significant changes as required under Section 1.4.1 of the OAP 1, which stipulates: “You agree to notify us properly in writing of any significant change of which you are aware of in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of described automobile. You also agree to let us know of any change that might increase the risk of an incident or affect our willingness to insure you at current rates.”

• Are convicted of a criminal offence involving the operation of an automobile.

9.3.8.4.4 Section 4.4: Limitations on Your Coverage

An insurer may refuse the payment of income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits (including students), and other expenses for the driver of an automobile if they:

• Knew or ought reasonably to have known that they were operating an automobile while it was not insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.

• Drive an automobile while not authorized by law to drive, or drive while excluded as a driver under the contract of automobile insurance.

• Drive a vehicle when they knew or ought to have reasonably known that they were operating an automobile without the owner’s consent.

An insured waives all entitlement to income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits, educational expenses, visitors’ expenses, housekeeping benefits, and maintenance expenses if they:

• Made or had knowledge of a material misrepresentation that induced the insurer to enter into a contract of automobile insurance.

• Intentionally failed to notify the insurer of a change in a material risk in the contract.

• Knew or ought to have reasonably known as an occupant that the driver was operating an automobile without the owner’s consent.

An insurer is entitled to hold amounts payable to the insured in trust under income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits, education benefits, visitors’ expenses, or housekeeping and maintenance benefits if the insured has been charged with a criminal offence at the time of the accident and was engaged in, or was an occupant of an automobile used in connection with committing, any of the following criminal offences:

• Operating an automobile while their ability to operate the automobile was impaired by alcohol or drugs.

• Operating an automobile while the concentration of alcohol in the driver’s blood exceeded the amount permitted by law.

• Failing to comply with the laws that command an individual to provide a breath sample.

• Any other criminal offence, whether or not the offence is related to the operation of an automobile.30

Once a criminal charge has been made pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code, the insurer is consequently entitled to retain any amounts payable to the insured in trust pending final disposition of the charge. Once the charge has been disposed of, the insurer will either be entitled to retain the funds or pay the funds out to the insured, depending upon whether the insured was found guilty of the offence.

9.3.8.5 Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage

9.3.8.5.1 Section 5.1: Introduction

Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage is designed to provide some protection for victims of accidents involving uninsured or unidentified drivers and/or automobiles. The Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act in Ontario requires all automobiles operated on public highways to be insured for a minimum of $200,000 of third-party liability coverage.

However, some drivers do continue to drive without insurance. Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage will respond when the insured is struck by an unidentified, identified, and/or uninsured automobile and suffers bodily injury and/or property damage.

Section 5.1: Introduction defines an uninsured automobile as one that neither the owner nor driver has liability insurance to cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of its ownership, use, or operation, or the insurance is not collectible. An unidentified automobile is one whose owner or driver cannot be identified.

Let’s look at the basic accident scenarios under Ontario’s no-fault insurance rules when different types of accidents involving uninsured automobiles require accident benefits to respond.

Image

When the not-at-fault party has catastrophic injuries, they would normally:

1) Collect from their own Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage first.

2) Sue the at-fault party’s Section 3: Liability Coverage for residual damages.

However, note that the at-fault party’s insurance policy is transparent in the diagram. This indicates that they have no insurance. In these situations, there needs to be a third step.

3) Collect from their own Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage for the type of coverage they would have recovered from the at-fault party’s coverage.

9.3.8.5.2 Section 5.2: What We Will Cover

9.3.8.5.2.1 Section 5.2.1: Claims by You or Other Insured Persons for Bodily Injury

The insurer will pay any amounts the insured or other insured persons have a legal right to recover as bodily injury damages from the owner or driver resulting from an accident involving an uninsured or unidentified automobile, up to the limits of this section.

An insured must be legally able to recover damages for bodily injury from the at-fault uninsured party before this coverage will respond. For economic loss suits, this is straightforward; however, claims for pain and suffering require the insured to have suffered a threshold injury. There can be no legal action allowed before the degree of injury sustained meets these minimum criteria.

To claim any bodily injury amounts under this section in Ontario, the injured person must have either:

• Died.

• Suffered a permanent serious disfigurement.

• Suffered a permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental, or psychological function.

The coverage responds as though it were the liability policy of the at-fault party. If the at-fault party is uninsured, Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage pays where the uninsured party’s policy would have paid, if they had one in place. The maximum amount payable under this section of the policy is the minimum limit of liability where the accident took place. In Ontario, the maximum payable for bodily injury claims is $200,000.

9.3.8.5.2.2 Section 5.2.2: Claims by Others for Bodily Injury or Death

If an insured dies as a result of an automobile accident, family members and others may pursue the at-fault motorist for damages caused due to the loss of that individual. Their claims will also be paid by the policy if the at-fault motorist is uninsured.

9.3.8.5.2.3 Section 5.2.3: Claims for Certain Property Damage

If the at-fault driver is identified and uninsured, claims can be made under the policy for damage to and loss of use of the automobile and its contents.

Note that there is no coverage for damage caused to the automobile by any unidentified automobile under this section of the policy. If this coverage were available, it would be open to too many fraud risks. Insureds involved in single-vehicle accidents who had not purchased any physical damage coverage (collision or all-perils), or who had purchased this coverage but did not wish to claim against it due to its effect on their driving record, would almost always claim the damage was caused by a “hit and run” driver.

Payments of property damage claims matching the required uninsured and identified driver requirements are limited to $25,000, and subject to the standard deductible of $300.

9.3.8.5.3 Section 5.3: Claims for Bodily Injury or Death

9.3.8.5.3.1 Section 5.3.1: Who Is Covered?

In Section 5.3.1: Who Is Covered? An “insured person” means:

• Any person who is an occupant of the automobile.

• The named insured, their spouse, and any dependant relative of either when:

- An occupant of an uninsured automobile.

- Not in an automobile, streetcar, or railway vehicle if hit by an unidentified or uninsured automobile (that is, a pedestrian).

Under this definition, the automobile includes any automobile for which coverage is provided under the policy. This includes the described automobile, as well as temporary substitute automobiles, newly acquired automobiles, and other automobiles defined in the policy. Any person who is an occupant in any of the automobiles who suffers a threshold injury caused by an unidentified and/or uninsured motorist can claim under this provision.

The named insured, their spouse, and their dependants can also claim under this provision if they are injured in an automobile accident which is the fault of the driver of the automobile in which they were an occupant, and that driver was uninsured. Again, the injured party would have to be in a legal position to sue, having met the threshold, and the payments would be limited to the minimum limit of insurance required in the state, province, or territory where the accident occurred.

Most importantly, if the insured, their spouse, or their dependant is struck and injured as a pedestrian by an uninsured or unidentified driver, this provision will respond. Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage is perhaps most valuable in these situations.

9.3.8.5.3.2 Section 5.3.4: Conditions Applying to Claims for Bodily Injury or Death

As with all coverage provided by the OAP 1, there are certain conditions placed upon the payment of claims under this section. When claiming bodily injury payments due to a threshold injury caused by an unidentified and/or uninsured motorist, the claimant must:

• Provide the insurer with written notice of the claim within 30 days of the accident. If this is not possible, due to medical reasons or some other equally important reason, the notice must be provided as soon as possible after that.

• Provide the insurer with as much evidence to support the claim as possible. A proof of loss should be submitted to the insurer within 90 days of the accident, giving details of the accident and the resulting loss. Again, if it is not possible to do so within the 90 days required, the claimant must do so as soon as possible after that.

• Provide the insurer with documentary evidence of the injury, whether psychological or medical, from an appropriate medical specialist for the types of injuries claimed for, if requested by the insurer. Documents should state the cause of the injury or death (that is, state that an automobile accident is the proximate cause of the injuries or death) and, i appropriate, state the expected duration of the injuries.

• Provide the insurer with any and all details of any other insurance contract (other than a life insurance contract if the claim is for loss of a family member) under which the claimant may be entitled to recover any other compensation.

9.3.8.5.3.3 Section 5.3.5: Accidents Involving Unidentified Automobiles

When an insured is injured due to an unidentified automobile, the police must be notified of the accident within 24 hours, or as soon as possible after that if the insured or their representative is unable to do so.

A written statement must be made within 30 days of the accident, giving all details of the accident to the insurer. The automobile in which the injured party was an occupant must also be made available for the insurer to inspect at their request.

9.3.8.5.4 Section 5.4: Claims for Property Damage

9.3.8.5.4.1 Section 5.4.2: Conditions Applying to Claims for Property Damage

The conditions applying to claims for property damage are very similar to Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. They are as follows:

• The insured must notify the insurer within seven days of the accident.

• The insured must protect the automobile from further damage, to the best of their ability.

• The insured must not make any repairs beyond those necessary to protect the vehicle from further damage without the permission of the insurer, or until the insurer has had time to inspect the vehicle.

• The insurer must be allowed to copy all legal documents pertaining to the accident.

• The insurer must be allowed to inspect the vehicle at any reasonable time.

• The insured must submit a proof of loss within 90 days.

• The insured cannot abandon the wreckage of the automobile into the care of the insurer unless the insurer has made settlement of the claim for the full actual cash value of the vehicle. At that point, the insurer owns the salvage.

9.3.8.5.4.2 Section 5.4.4: How Much We Will Pay

The insurer’s maximum liability for damage to the automobile is the actual cash value (ACV) of the automobile at the time of the loss, minus the deductible applicable to the coverage shown on the coverage summary page.

An automobile’s ACV is determined by taking its original cost, and then deducting all applicable depreciation from that amount.

For example:

If a vehicle originally cost $25,000 in 2014, by 2023, nine years of depreciation would be subtracted from the original purchase price. If the vehicle was worth $25,000 in 2014, it may be worth only $8,000 in 2021. The mileage driven, the condition of the vehicle, and maintenance schedules all contribute to the amount of depreciation to be subtracted. In very simple terms, a vehicle’s ACV can be thought of as the price the insured could have sold it for immediately prior to the loss.

The insurer will repair the automobile if it is cheaper to do so, with parts of like kind and quality as existed on or within the automobile at the time of the loss (minus the deductible).

9.3.8.5.5 Section 5.5: Claims for Both Bodily Injury and Property Damage

Claims often arise for both bodily injury and property damage caused by the same accident. In these instances, the coverage applicable under this section will be apportioned 95% for bodily injury claims and 5% for the property damage suffered.

Let’s look at an example:

While driving his new Mercedes SL500, Yuri (who is insured) is struck and injured by an uninsured automobile. Yuri suffered a threshold injury, and the damage to his vehicle totals $30,000. If Yuri plans to sue for $300,000 for the bodily injury suffered, the total suit would be for $330,000. Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage pays up to the minimum limit in the province where the accident occurred; in Ontario, this is $200,000. Because the total amount of the claim cannot be paid under this coverage limit, payments are then broken down according to the two parts: $190,000 (95%) for the bodily injury claim and $10,000 (5%) for the property damage claim.

9.3.8.5.6 Section 5.7: Limitations and Exceptions

9.3.8.5.6.1 Section 5.7.1: Payment Limits

Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage is limited to the minimum legal limit of automobile liability insurance in the jurisdiction where the accident occurs. This is the maximum amount payable, regardless of the amount of property damage suffered or the number of victims injured or killed in any single accident.

The insurer will also not pay:

• Anything under this coverage if there exists an automobile liability insurance policy from which the injured insured party can claim.

• Any amount for an accident occurring in a jurisdiction where the injured party may make a claim from an unsatisfied judgment fund or similar fund created for the purpose of compensating victims of uninsured or unidentified motorists.

- The OAP 1 will not pay in any jurisdiction where a fund exists to compensate victims for essentially the same losses. (All provinces in Canada have a Highway Victims Indemnity Fund or Unsatisfied Judgment Fund. The territories do not have a fund, nor do most American states.) Ontario’s Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (our equivalent of a Highway Victims Indemnity Fund), does not recognize any claim from a person insured under a valid insurance policy; therefore, Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage will pay.

• Losses caused by radioactive contamination or radioactive materials.

• The first $300 (standard deductible) of any accidental damage to the automobile or its contents.

• Amounts over $25,000 for damage to the automobile or its contents in any one accident.

• For loss or damage while a person specifically excluded from the policy is driving the automobile.

Before we leave this section, let’s review:

• Coverage is limited to the minimum limit of automobile liability insurance in the jurisdiction where the accident took place. In Ontario, this is $200,000.

• Insurers will pay claims for bodily injury suffered by an insured person caused by uninsured and/or unidentified drivers.

• Insurers will pay claims for property damage to automobiles and their contents caused by identified and uninsured drivers.

• Property damage claims are limited to $25,000 for any one accident and are subject to a standard $300 deductible.

• In the event of a claim for both bodily injury and property damage arising from the same accident, the limit of coverage will be apportioned as 95% ($190,000 in Ontario) for bodily injury claims and 5% ($10,000 in Ontario) for property damage claims.

9.3.8.6 Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage

Coverage under Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage is provided for loss or damage to the insured automobile and certain trailers, their equipment, contents, and their loss of use. In 2024, the Ontario Government introduced a new change form to the OAP 1 that allows a policyholder to remove the DCPD coverage from their policy. DCPD is still a mandatory coverage, but with OPCF 49, it creates an opt-out approach for consumers if they want to save money on their premium. For the purposes of your exam, you do not need to know more about OPCF 49 than awareness of what it is and what it does; the operational details will come when you work in your brokerage.

The basic function of the coverage is to pay for damage occurring to the insured automobile which is not the insured’s fault. For the coverage to apply, the accident must take place in Ontario and must involve at least one other vehicle insured under a motor vehicle liability policy issued by an insurer licensed in Ontario.

If the insured is involved in an accident with another motorist, the natural assumption is that the damage to the insured’s vehicle caused by the other motorist should be paid for by the other motorist. In most other provinces, this would be the case. However, the disadvantage to that system is the time it takes to recover the money to pay for the repairs required. These systems require the insured to pursue a legal action against the at-fault motorist for damages. Court costs, legal fees, and lengthy litigations increase costs for everybody. In the end, the insurers pay the claims through liability coverage, defending these actions and paying court costs over and above the physical damage caused to a vehicle.

In contrast, Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage (DCPD) Coverage is designed to prevent these small lawsuits from having to go to court. All insurers in Ontario pay for damage to their insured’s vehicles under Section 6: DCPD Coverage to the extent (percentage) that the insured is not at fault. The standard deductible for DCPD is $0. However, many insureds decide to add a deductible to help reduce their premium, so we have included deductibles in the examples below.

Let’s use two scenarios to look at how fault is determined under Section 6: DCPD Coverage claims.

Scenario 1

Actual cash value: $25,000

Percentage the insured is not at fault: 100%

Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible elected: $500

Image

Step 1: Determine the degree to which the insured is not at fault (NAF) (100%).

Step 2: Multiply that number by the deductible (D) to determine how much the insured pays.

D: $500 × NAF: 100% = $500

Step 3: Multiply that number by the value of the vehicle (V) to determine how much the insurer pays.

V: $25,000 × NAF: 100% = $25,000

Step 4: Subtract the deductible (D) from the value (V) to determine the payout.

V: $25,000 – D: $500 = $24,500

This means the insured’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay $24,500.

Scenario 2

Actual cash value: $25,000

Percentage the insured is not at fault: 75%

Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible elected: $300

Image

Step 1: Determine the degree to which the insured is not at fault (NAF) (75%).

Step 2: Multiply that number by the deductible (D) to determine how much the insured pays.

D: $300 × NAF: 75% = $225

Step 3: Multiply that number by the value of the vehicle (V) to determine how much the insurer pays.

V: $25,000 × NAF: 75% = $18,750

Step 4: Subtract the deductible (D) from the value (V) to determine the payout.

V: $18,750 – D: $225 = $18,525

This means the insured’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay $18,525.

Let’s consider two more examples. Here’s the first:

Alexei was sitting in his car, stopped at a red light, when he was struck from behind by Randy. In this case, Randy is considered to be 100% at fault for the accident, so Alexei is considered to be 100% not at fault for the accident.

Alexei’s automobile suffers $5,000 damage due to the accident. Alexei’s insurer will pay for the cost of repairs and temporary replacement transportation (for example, rental cars or taxis, buses, etc.) under the Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

And here’s the second:

Jamal and Angela are involved in a collision for which they are both considered to be 50% at fault. Jamal’s vehicle suffers $4,000 damage. His insurer, under the Section 6: DCPD Coverage, will pay only for the portion of the damage which he is not at fault for. He is 50% at fault, which means he is 50% not at fault. Jamal’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay for 50% of the $4,000 damage ($2,000).

We can use the same rationale to determine how much Angela will receive from her insurer under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage. She was determined to be 50% at fault, and 50% not at fault, for the accident. If Angela suffers $2,600 damage to her vehicle, her insurer will pay $1,300 toward the damage under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

The difference between each of their losses and respective payments under Section 6: DCPD Coverage can be claimed under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) if either had purchased the optional collision coverage.

9.3.8.6.1 Section 6.2: What We Will Cover

Section 6.2: What We Will Cover refers to Section 263 of Ontario’s Insurance Act. It states that this portion of coverage is reserved specifically for loss or damage to the automobile, its contents, and its loss of use.

Since the coverage is designed to pay when the insured is not at fault or not responsible for damage caused in an accident, the coverage extends to pay for a replacement automobile or expenses for replacement transportation (for example, a rental car, taxis, buses, etc.). The coverage also pays for any contents of the vehicle which are damaged due to the accident.

With few exceptions, an insured motorist generally cannot sue a negligent motorist in Ontario for damage caused to the insured automobile. The creation of a DCPD agreement between all insurers who insure automobiles in Ontario removes the necessity for lawsuits to recover money for damage caused to an insured’s vehicle by a negligent motorist. Recovery is now made from each insurer when the accident is considered to be the fault of another motorist.

For the Section 6: DCPD Coverage to apply, two conditions must be met:

1) Both vehicles involved in the accident must be insured under automobile policies issued by licensed insurers in Ontario, or insurers from outside Ontario who have agreed to be bound by this section; and

2) The accident must take place in Ontario.

The insurer will not pay more to repair or replace the automobile than its ACV at the time of the loss, less the applicable percentage of the deductible shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance for the coverage.

There is a standard deductible of $500 on the Section 6: DCPD Coverage. However, the policy refers to the applicable percentage of the deductible being deducted from the settlement. If the insured is 100% not at fault for an accident causing $5,000 damage, the insurer will pay $5,000, less 100% of the deductible (or $500), making the total settlement $4,500. If the insured had been 40% at fault and 60% not at fault, the insurer would pay 60% of the $5,000 ($3,000), less 60% of the deductible ($300). The settlement in that case would be $2,700.

Note: Most insureds can pay a higher premium to reduce their deductible to $0.

The bolded sentence (“You should be aware that this coverage does not apply if the automobile is described in another motor vehicle liability policy”) can be difficult to interpret. Here’s what it means: The OAP 1 provides coverage for the described automobile, newly acquired automobiles, temporary substitute automobiles, and other automobiles, as defined earlier in the text. However, Section 6: DCPD Coverage primarily applies to described automobiles and newly acquired automobiles. This is because these are vehicles owned by the named insured; temporary substitute automobiles and other automobiles belong to someone other than the insured. If the owner of the vehicle being driven has an insurance policy covering temporary substitute automobiles,31 the policy will not pay Section 6: DCPD Coverage. The owner’s policy would pay for the damage to the automobile, because the owner’s policy always pays first and is considered the primary coverage for all vehicle damage claims.

If the at-fault motorist is not insured, damage to the not-at-fault motorist’s automobile can, in some cases, be claimed under Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage. If the uninsured motorist cannot be identified, the not-at-fault motorist may not be able to recover any money for their loss.

9.3.8.6.2 Section 6.4: How Much We Will Pay

9.3.8.6.2.1 Section 6.4.1: Determining Fault

Without Section 6: DCPD Coverage, and in tort provinces such as Alberta, the degree of fault apportioned to each driver in an accident is determined by the judge presiding over the lawsuit. In Ontario, the amount of fault apportioned is determined by the Fault Determination Rules within the Insurance Act Regulations.

If an insured disagrees with the degree of fault apportioned to them by the Fault Chart and the settlement presented by the insurer, they may sue their own insurer. The judge presiding over the case may alter the apportionment initially assigned by the Fault Determination Rules.

Regulation 668 contains the charts that insurers use to determine their insureds’ degree of fault in any given accident situation.

9.3.8.6.3 Section 6.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities

The conditions in Section 6.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities are very similar to Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. They are as follows:

• The insured must notify the insurer within seven days of the accident.

• The insured must protect the automobile from further damage, to the best of their ability.

• The insured must not make any repairs beyond those necessary to protect the vehicle further without the permission of the insurer, or until the insurer has had time to inspect the vehicle.

• The insurer must be allowed to copy all legal documents pertaining to the accident.

• The insurer must be allowed to inspect the vehicle at any reasonable time.

• The insured must submit a proof of loss within 90 days.

• The insured cannot abandon the wreckage of the automobile into the care of the insurer unless the insurer has made settlement of the claim for the full actual cash value of the vehicle. At that point, the insurer owns the salvage.

9.3.8.7 Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional)

Loss or damage coverage, sometimes referred to as “physical damage coverage,” indemnifies the registered owner of a described automobile for loss of or damage to the insured automobile and its equipment only. Coverage is divided into four separate sections. While insureds are not obligated to purchase any of these coverages, they provide financial protection for the value of the vehicle in the event of a loss.

While these coverages are part of the standard policy, they do not apply to any described automobile insured by the policy unless a premium is shown for them, or the policy states they are being provided at no cost on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.

Since September 1, 2010, if an insured is involved in an accident and is deemed to be 25% or less at fault, the accident cannot be used to increase premiums in the future.

All coverages within Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) are subject to a deductible.

9.3.8.7.1 Section 7.1: Introduction

9.3.8.7.1.1 Section 7.1.1: Coverage for Loss of or Damage to Your Automobile

Section 7.1.1: Coverage for Loss of or Damage to Your Automobile contains the following sentence:

“This Section applies only to the extent that a claim for damage to an automobile and its equipment would not be covered by Section 6, Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage of a motor vehicle liability policy.”

As we just learned, Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage (DCPD) Coverage pays for damage to the automobile when the insured is not at fault in an accident. If payment has been made for damage under Section 6: DCPD Coverage, no payment can be claimed under this section. Damage to the vehicle from almost any other cause can be claimed under one of these four sections of loss or damage coverage. As mentioned in Section 9.3.8.6, if a policyholder has added OPCF 49 and removed DCPD from their coverages, then this coverage is affected by relation. As you will learn, Sections 6 and 7 of the OAP 1 are intertwined, so if DCPD is not in effect, much of the collision and comprehensive coverages in Section 7 also do not respond to physical damage.

Since the insurer is paying for the restitution of damage to the insured automobile, the insurer reserves the right to inspect the automobile at all reasonable times. At the inception of a new policy, insurers often require an inspection of the vehicle before these coverages are granted. If the inspection request is not completed by the insured, coverages under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) may be removed from the policy, and claims under these sections may be denied.

9.3.8.7.1.2 Section 7.1.2: Coverage Options

9.3.8.7.1.2.1 Coverage A: Specified Perils

Coverage A: Specified Perils limits payments for damages to those caused directly by the following perils:

• Fire.

• Theft or attempted theft.

• Lightning.

• Windstorm.

• Hail or rising water.

• Earthquake.

• Explosion.

• Riot or civil disturbance.

• Falling or forced landing of aircraft or parts of aircraft.

• The stranding, sinking, burning, derailment or collision of any kind of transport in, or upon which a described automobile is being carried on, land or water.

9.3.8.7.1.2.2 Coverage B: Comprehensive

Coverage B: Comprehensive is an all-risks version of Coverage A: Specified Perils. It includes everything within Coverage A: Specified Perils, as well as the perils of falling or flying objects, missiles, and vandalism.

All damage to the vehicle not caused by a collision of some kind is covered under Coverage B: Comprehensive, unless specifically excluded.

9.3.8.7.1.2.3 Coverage C: Collision or Upset

Coverage C: Collision or Upset pays for all damage suffered when the insured automobile is involved in a collision with another object, or upset (tips over). Collision occurs when the vehicle hits something in contact with the ground. Upset damage occurs when the only thing the vehicle hits is the ground.

Note: Collisions with animals, such as deer or moose, are usually paid out under Coverage B: Comprehensive.

9.3.8.7.1.2.4 Coverage D: All Perils

This option combines the coverage of Coverage C: Collision or Upset and Coverage B: Comprehensive. The benefit to purchasing Coverage D: All Perils instead of separately purchasing Coverage C: Collision or Upset and Coverage B: Comprehensive is that Coverage D: All Perils includes two types of theft that are excluded under Coverage B: Comprehensive.

While Coverage B: Comprehensive excludes theft of the vehicle by a person who lives in the insured household, Coverage D: All Perils includes it. Coverage D: All Perils also includes theft of the vehicle by an employee who drives or uses, services, or repairs the described automobile. See Section 9.3.8.7.2.3: Section 7.2.3: Certain Thefts Not Covered for more information.

9.3.8.7.2 Section 7.2: Loss or Damage We Won’t Cover

9.3.8.7.2.1 Section 7.2.1: General

Since Coverage B: Comprehensive and Coverage D: All Perils are both all-risks policies, there are a number of exclusions applicable to these coverages.

The first three exclusions listed in Section 7.2.1: General are wear and tear exclusions:

1) Damage to tires.

2) Breakdown of any part of the automobile.

3) Any damage consisting of or caused by rusting, corrosion, wear and tear, freezing, or explosion within the engine.

The next two exclusions are types of theft claims that will not be honoured:

4) Damage resulting from an illegal claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement such as a mortgage or lease agreement. If the insured misses payments on their lease and the vehicle is repossessed, the insurer will not pay if the insured makes a theft claim for loss of the vehicle.

5) Loss or damage resulting from a change in ownership that is agreed to, even if that change was brought about by trickery or fraud. The policy provides an example of selling the car to a stranger at a party in exchange for a cheque. If the cheque bounces, the insured cannot claim the vehicle was stolen.

Additional exclusions include:

6) Damage caused by radioactive contamination.

7) Damage to contents of automobiles and trailers, other than their equipment. This section pays only for loss of or damage to the insured automobile. Equipment is defined as anything provided with the automobile or trailer to be used with the vehicle, and anything that is a permanent fixture in the automobile. For example, a scissor jack is not permanently attached to the automobile, but it would be considered equipment provided with the automobile for use with the automobile. Other examples include motorcycle helmets and child car seats.

8) Reimbursement for recorded material (CDs) is limited to $25. Only recorded material that was in the playing device at the time of loss is covered. Any recorded material in the vehicle’s storage cases or visor holders is considered contents of the automobile and is therefore not covered.

9.3.8.7.2.2 Section 7.2.2: Illegal Use

Insureds who engage in illegal uses of the automobile forfeit any claim for physical damage payable under the policy. The policy lists some very specific illegal uses and illegal activities which render Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) forfeit. They include:

• Any damage caused to the automobile while the insured was operating it while intoxicated.

• Damage caused for any action which also results in the insured being convicted of any of the following offences under the Criminal Code of Canada:

- Causing death by criminal negligence.

- Causing bodily harm by criminal negligence.

- Dangerous operation of a motor vehicle.

- Failure to stop at the scene of an accident.

- Operation of a motor vehicle when impaired or with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in the blood.

- Refusal to comply with the demand for a breath sample.

- Causing bodily harm during operation of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or a drug, or a combination of alcohol and a drug, or while the concentration of alcohol or drug in the operator’s blood exceeds the limit permitted by law.

- Operating a motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so.

- If the insured uses or allows the automobile to be used in a race or speed test, or for illegal activity.

- If the insured drives the automobile while not authorized by law.

- If another person, with the insured’s permission, drives or operates the automobile under any of these conditions.

9.3.8.7.2.3 Section 7.2.3: Certain Thefts Not Covered

As explained in Section 9.3.8.7.1.2.4: Coverage D: All Perils, the policy describes (1) the theft of the automobile by a member of the insured’s household and (2) the theft by an employee of the insured who drives or uses, repairs, or services the automobile. Both types of theft are excluded under Coverage A: Specified Perils and Coverage B: Comprehensive. However, Coverage D: All Perils is not subject to these two exclusions.

9.3.8.7.3 Section 7.3: The Deductible

We know that the deductible is the amount of any loss that the insured agrees to pay. The deductible amount is stated in the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. The standard deductibles in Ontario are currently $500 for Coverage C: Collision or Upset losses and $500 for Coverage A: Specified Perils or Coverage B: Comprehensive claims, as of June 1, 2016.

There are two types of losses not subject to the deductible under these coverages: fire losses and lightning losses. All other losses covered under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) are subject to the deductible. If the loss is caused by any insured peril other than fire or lightning, the insurer will pay the amount of the damage minus the deductible.

The policy lists a few examples of how Coverage C: Collision or Upset integrates with the Section 6: DCPD Coverage for payment of damages to the insured vehicle caused by a collision with another motorist.

Let’s revisit two examples from Section 9.3.8.6: Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage. We’ll now apply Coverage C: Collision or Upset to those earlier situations. We will assume the standard $500 deductible also applies to the Section 6: DCPD Coverage for these two examples.

Here’s the first example:

Alexei was sitting in his car, stopped at a red light when he was struck from behind by Randy. In this case, Randy is considered to be 100% at fault for the accident, so Alexei is considered to be 100% not at fault for the accident.

Alexei’s automobile suffers $5,000 damage due to the accident. Alexei’s insurer will pay for the cost of repairs (less the $500 deductible) and temporary replacement transportation (for example, rental cars or taxis, buses, etc.) under Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

Randy, who is 100% at fault for the accident, would claim for the damage to his vehicle under his optional Coverage C: Collision or Upset. Assuming the damage to Randy’s car is $3,000, he would receive $2,500 from his insurer after the deductible was subtracted from the amount payable. Unlike Alexei, Randy will not be reimbursed for a temporary transportation replacement while his automobile is being repaired; there is no provision for such coverage in Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional). If Randy had purchased a separate endorsement (OPCF 20: Coverage for Transportation Replacement), he may be entitled to the coverage, but he would have had to purchase the coverage before the accident took place.

Here’s the second example:

Jamal and Angela are involved in a collision for which they are both considered to be 50% at fault. Jamal’s vehicle suffers $4,000 damage. His insurer, under Section 6: DCPD Coverage, will pay only for the portion of the damage which he is not at fault for. He is 50% at fault, which means he is 50% not at fault. Jamal’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay for 50% of the $4,000 damage ($2,000). His insurer will then deduct from that amount 50% of the Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible. (Since the payment of the loss is partial in this case, the application of the deductible matches the percentage of the payment.) 50% of the $500 deductible is $250. Therefore, $250 is deducted from the $2,000 payment. Jamal will receive $1,750 from his Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

Then, he will claim the damage for which he is at fault from Coverage C: Collision or Upset. The mathematics will work the same: 50% of the damage is covered under Coverage C: Collision or Upset, so 50% of the deductible will apply. The payment will be $2,000 minus $250 ($1,750). This means that, in total, for the $4,000 loss, Jamal will recover $3,500 from his insurer.

We can use the same rationale to determine how much Angela will receive from her insurer under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage and Coverage C: Collision or Upset. She was determined to be 50% at fault, and 50% not at fault, for the accident. If Angela suffers $2,600 damage to her vehicle, her insurer will pay $1,300 minus 50% of the $500 Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible ($250) for a total of $1,050 under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage. If she then claims the damage for which she is at fault from Coverage C: Collision or Upset, her insurer would pay $1,300 minus 50% of the $500 collision deductible ($250), for a total of $1,050 under her collision coverage. That means that, in total, for the $2,600 loss, Angela will recover $2,100 from her insurer.

If the Section 6: DCPD Coverage and Coverage C: Collision or Upset deductibles are the same, the insured will always pay the same deductible amount for any percentage of fault in a collision.

9.3.8.7.4 Section 7.4: Additional Benefits

The additional benefits below are coverages for indirect financial losses suffered concurrently with the damage to an automobile. The policy covers four such losses.

9.3.8.7.4.1 Section 7.4.1: Payment of Charges

9.3.8.7.4.1.1 General Average Charges

General average charges occur as a result of marine law. If a boat begins to sink while on route from one port to another, the captain of the boat will order the cargo on board to be jettisoned to reduce the weight of the boat and slow the sinking. However, in many instances, not all the cargo needs to be jettisoned — it is the sacrifice of a small portion that ensures the well-being of the majority of the shipment. Marine law states that all owners of cargo which is saved from the loss must share in the compensation of those owners whose cargo was thrown overboard. The cost of the lost cargo is divided between all owners of the cargo which survived. The assessed portion of damage each cargo owner must pay is referred to as a “general average charge.”

If an insured’s vehicle is on a ferry boat that starts to sink, the cars at the back of the ferry will be jettisoned to reduce weight. When the ferry lands, all owners of automobiles not jettisoned will be required to pay a fair portion of the cost to replace the vehicles jettisoned. The OAP 1 covers these general average charges.

9.3.8.7.4.1.2 Salvage Charges

The policy requires the insured to take all reasonable steps necessary to protect the automobile from further damage following an insured loss. While no repairs may be made without the express consent of the insurer, an allowance is made for repairs necessary to reduce further or continuing damage. Any expenses incurred by the insured to protect the vehicle from further damage will be reimbursed by the insurer. Necessary towing charges are also reimbursed under this provision.

9.3.8.7.4.1.3 Fire Department Charges

If the vehicle catches fire and the fire department is called to extinguish it, the fire department will bill the insured for their services. The insurer will pay the fire department charges on behalf of the insured.

9.3.8.7.4.1.4 Customs Duties

If an insured is vacationing in the United States and is involved in an accident (for example, damaging their fender), Coverage C: Collision or Upset will respond to the damage repair costs to install a replacement. When returning to Canada, the insured is technically importing a new fender. The insurer will pay the import duties on any new parts necessary for the repairs.

9.3.8.7.4.2 Section 7.4.2: Foregoing Our Right to Recover

The insurer waives its right of subrogation against a party responsible for damage to the insured vehicle if the party responsible was given permission by the insured to use the described automobile. However, there are two notable exceptions to this rule:

1) If the person responsible for the damage is in the business of parking, servicing, or selling automobiles. These individuals are bailees to whom insureds have entrusted their vehicle, and they have a legal responsibility to return the vehicle to the insured in the same or better condition as it was presented to them. These individuals have their own policy to cover automobiles of their customers.

2) If the person permitted to use the automobile uses it for any of the excluded uses or criminal activities prohibited by the policy. If the insured’s friend takes the car and is involved in an accident during its regular use, the insurer will pay for the loss and not subrogate. If the insured’s friend damages the automobile while engaged in a speed test or race, any loss paid out by the insurer will be recovered from the insured’s friend.

9.3.8.7.4.3 Section 7.4.3: Temporary Substitute Automobiles Covered

We learned about temporary substitute automobiles (TSAs) in Section 9.3.8.2.2.2: Section 2.2.2: Temporary Substitute Automobile. TSAs are automobiles not owned by the insured, or anyone else in the insured’s dwelling, that the insured is using while their own automobile is unusable due to its breakdown, theft, repair, servicing, sale, or destruction.

Coverage for physical damage to the TSA will be provided by the TSA owner’s insurance policy if they have purchased Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional). If the owner of the TSA has not purchased this coverage, and the insured is legally liable for the damage to the TSA, then the policy will pay for the damage, less the applicable deductible. The liability for the damage must be imposed by law or agreed to by the insured under contract.

If the owner of the TSA has coverage under their own policy, but their deductible is higher than the deductible on the insured’s policy, then the policy will pay for the difference between the deductibles. Technically, the insurer is paying the deductible amount on the TSA owner’s policy, as that sum represents an amount of loss suffered which is not covered anywhere else. The insurer pays all claims less the deductible showing on the insured’s policy, so the final amount is the difference between the deductibles.

Let’s look at an example.

Kenji’s Toyota Corolla has Coverage C: Collision and Upset with a $500 deductible and Coverage B: Comprehensive with a $500 deductible. His automobile is at the dealership for a lengthy service, so he borrows Alma’s Tesla to get to and from work for the day.

Alma’s car is much more expensive than Kenji’s and, although it also has Coverage C: Collision and Upset and Coverage B: Comprehensive, the deductibles on Alma’s policy are $5,000 and $1,000, respectively.

Kenji isn’t used to driving Alma’s car. He loses control of the vehicle and drives it into a tree on the side of the road, causing $10,000 of damage.

Since Alma has purchased Coverage C: Collision, her policy pays for the damage, less the $5,000 deductible. Since Alma has suffered a $5,000 loss, Kenji’s insurer will pay $5,000 toward the loss, less the deductible of $500 ($4,500).

9.3.8.7.4.4 Section 7.4.4: Loss of Use Due to Theft

If the described automobile is stolen, and the insured has purchased theft coverage (that is, Coverage A: Specified Perils, Coverage B: Comprehensive, or Coverage D: All Perils), the insurer will pay reasonable expenses for the rental of a similar substitute automobile or, if the insured chooses not to rent, pay reasonable expenses for taxis and/or public transportation instead. The maximum payable under this additional benefit is $900.

The payment of these expenses will not begin until 72 hours after the insured has reported the theft to the police or the insurer. The coverage will extend until the insured vehicle is repaired (if recovered) or replaced, or sooner if money is offered to settle the claim. As long as coverage was in place at the time of the theft, this coverage will continue until the claim is settled, even if the policy expires in the meantime.

9.3.8.7.5 SECTION 7.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities

The conditions under Section 7.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities are very similar to Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. They are as follows:

• The insured must notify the insurer within seven days of the accident.

• The insured must protect the automobile from further damage, to the best of their ability.

• The insured must not make any repairs beyond those necessary to protect the vehicle further without the permission of the insurer, or until the insurer has had time to inspect the vehicle.

• The insurer must be allowed to copy all legal documents pertaining to the accident.

• The insurer must be allowed to inspect the vehicle at any reasonable time.

• The insured must submit a proof of loss within 90 days.

• The insured cannot abandon the wreckage of the automobile into the care of the insurer unless the insurer has made settlement of the claim for the full actual cash value of the vehicle. At that point, the insurer owns the salvage.

9.3.8.7.6 Section 7.6: Our Right to Repair, Replace, or Rebuild the Automobile

Section 7.6: Our Right to Repair, Replace, or Rebuild the Automobile is a plain language wording of Subsection (6) of Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. The insurer has the sole discretion to decide which form of indemnity will be used. If the insurer chooses to repair, replace, or rebuild the automobile instead of making a cash settlement for the loss, the insurer will notify the insured within seven days of the accident. Work will be completed within a reasonable time.

9.3.8.7.7 SECTION 7.7: What We Will Pay

An insurer’s maximum liability for loss or damage to an insured automobile is the ACV of the automobile at the time of the loss, less the deductible.

Note: Section 7.7: What We Will Pay mentions a $1,500 limit for after-market electronic accessories and equipment. Most people think of this limitation primarily as it relates to car audio equipment, but today’s automobiles can have devices ranging from GPS systems to infotainment modules installed after purchase. This stipulation is similar to the $25 limit on recorded material (see Section 9.3.8.7.2.1: Section 7.2.1: General).

9.3.8.8 Section 8: Statutory Conditions

We learned about the concept of Statutory Conditions in Chapter 5: Regulation of Insurance Contracts, as they relate to policies insuring for the peril of fire. Similarly, the OAP 1 Statutory Conditions outline the legal duties and responsibilities of each party to the contract and are binding on all parties. Insureds must be advised that when they breach Statutory Conditions applicable to them, they will normally lose their coverage.

The Statutory Conditions for automobile insurance policies are essentially the same for all provinces. However, some provincial variations exist. Ontario’s automobile Statutory Conditions include:

• Statutory Condition 1: Material Change in Risk.

• Statutory Condition 2: Incorrect Classification.

• Statutory Condition 3: Monthly Payments.

• Statutory Condition 4: Authority to Drive.

• Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property.

• Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile.

• Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit.

• Statutory Condition 8: Inspection of Automobile.

• Statutory Condition 9: Time and Manner of Payment of Insurance Money.

• Statutory Condition 10: Who May Give Notice and Proof of Claim.

• Statutory Condition 11: Termination.

• Statutory Condition 12: Notice.

• Statutory Condition 13: Statutory Accident Benefits Protected.

The Insurance Act requires that these conditions are printed in every automobile insurance policy in Ontario. While violation of any of the Statutory Conditions generally results in the denial of coverage, there are some exceptions. In its efforts to limit the right to sue, the government introduced legislative changes to ensure that certain accident benefits are available regardless of any violation of the Statutory Conditions. Refer to Section 31 of the SABS for details of the circumstances in which certain benefits are not payable.

Many of the Statutory Conditions are presented in plain language and have been incorporated into the OAP 1 sections we’ve learned about:

• Section 1.4: Your Responsibilities.

• Section 1.5: Where to Make a Claim and Who May Make It.

• Section 1.6: Our Rights and Responsibilities.

• Section 1.7: Cancelling Your Insurance.

Let’s look at each of the Statutory Conditions in more detail.

9.3.8.8.1 Statutory Condition 1: Material Change in Risk

Insureds must notify the insurer promptly, in writing, of any change within their knowledge that is material to the contract. The insurer must be advised of any change which occurs after the policy has been issued which serves to increase the chance for loss.

Other factors which may be material and are required to be reported to the insurer include:

• Change in insurable interest: If this change occurs without the actual transfer of the automobile, the insurer’s exposure may be increased. For example, if the automobile is given to a member of the insured’s family, the new owner and principal driver may represent a greater exposure to the insurer.

• Addition of mortgage or lien: If a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance affecting the automobile is made after the application has been completed, the insurer must be notified. If no notification is given, coverage for loss or damage to the automobile may be denied.

• Other insurance: When other insurance for physical damage is purchased during the policy period, the insurer must be advised. Insurers need to know about the potential for fraudulent losses when insureds purchase insurance from more than one insurer.

9.3.8.8.2 Statutory Condition 2: Incorrect Classification

If a client has been incorrectly rated, the insurer is required to make the necessary correction. This may require refunding any excess premium and paying interest at the bank rate on the overpayment.

If a correction requires additional premium to be paid, it must be requested within 60 days after the contract is made. No interest is charged.

9.3.8.8.3 Statutory Condition 3: Monthly Payments

This condition allows the client to pay the premium in equal monthly installments. The interest rate is in accordance with the Regulations in the Insurance Act.

9.3.8.8.4 Statutory Condition 4: Authority to Drive

The insured will not drive or operate the automobile unless they are authorized by law to drive or operate it. This requirement also applies to anyone else that the insured may permit to drive.

To be authorized, the driver must have a valid license. Additionally, failure to renew the license may invalidate the coverages.

The insured is prohibited to use or permit the vehicle to be used in the following situations:

• Races or speed tests.

• Any illicit or prohibited trades or professions.

9.3.8.8.5 Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property

Let’s examine the subsections of Statutory Condition 5 in detail.

“(1) The insured shall:

(a) give to the insurer written notice, with all available particulars, of any accident involving loss or damage to persons or property and of any claim made on account of the incident;”

The OAP defines “notice” in Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit. The written notice specified here must be delivered within seven days of the incident, provided the insured is able to do so. If the insured is unable to provide this notice due to incapacity or injury, the insured must provide this notice as soon as possible thereafter. The requirement for notice is important because the failure to provide such notice could result in a loss of coverage.

The courts have ruled that the obligation for notice depends on the circumstances of the loss. For example, in accidents involving serious bodily injury or property damage to others, it is expected that the insurer will be advised immediately. On the other hand, more time would be permitted to report an accident with more minor (or less invasive) damage, like running over a neighbour’s bicycle left on the insured’s driveway.”

(b) verify by statutory declaration, if required by the insurer, that the claim arose out of the use or operation of the automobile and that the person operating or responsible for the operation of the automobile at the time of the accident is a person insured under this contract; and

(c) forward immediately to the insurer every letter, document, advice or statement of claim received by the insured from or on behalf of the claimant.”

The insurer has both a right and a duty to defend the insured in any legal action. When it is clear that the other party involved in the accident is contemplating or has initiated legal action against the insured, copies of all legal documents received by the insured must be forwarded immediately to the insurer.

“(2) The insured shall not:

(a) voluntarily assume any liability or settle any claim except at the insured’s own cost; or…”

Insureds must be advised that any voluntary assumption of liability, or efforts they take to settle any claim on their own, may impair the ability of the insurer to provide a proper defence.

The right to investigate, defend, and settle claims rests with the insurer and not the insured. Accordingly, any obligations or costs incurred without the consent of the insurer are not recoverable under the policy.

“(b) Interfere in any negotiations for settlement or in any legal proceeding.”

As the insured’s irrevocable attorney, the insurer has full control over the settlement and defence of all claims against the insured. Under this Statutory Condition, the insured agrees not to interfere in those proceedings.

“(3) The insured shall, whenever requested by the insurer, aid in securing information and evidence and the attendance of any witness and shall co-operate with the insurer, except in a pecuniary way, in the defence of any action or proceeding or in the prosecution of any appeal.”

Insureds are required to assist the insurer in their defence. When requested to do so, these costs will be paid by the insurer.

9.3.8.8.6 Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to the Automobile

Statutory Requirement 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to the Automobile begins as follows:

“(1) Where loss of or damage to the automobile occurs, the insured shall, if the loss or damage is covered by this contract,

(a) give notice thereof in writing to the insurer with the fullest information obtainable at the time;

(b) at the expense of the insurer, and as far as reasonably possible, protect the automobile from further loss or damage; and”

This Statutory Condition contains the rules for claims involving loss or damage to the insured automobile. Specifically, the insured must take all reasonable steps to protect the automobile from further damage.

There are benefits to insurers when they pay these costs. For example, removing the automobile from the accident site will normally prevent theft, vandalism, and other losses which might otherwise occur if the automobile were left there.

Statutory Requirement 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to the Automobile also explains that the insured must provide the insurer with prompt written notice of any claim:

“(c) deliver to the insurer within ninety days after the date of the loss or damage a statutory declaration stating, to the best of the insured’s knowledge and belief, the place, time, cause and amount of the loss or damage, the interest of the insured and of all others therein, the encumbrances thereon, all other insurance, whether valid or not, covering the automobile and that the loss or damage did not occur directly or indirectly through any willful act or neglect of the insured.”

The insured must provide a proof of loss within 90 days of the date of the accident. If not, the insurer is not legally bound to honor the claim. In practice, most insurers will provide payment when a proof of loss is received after the allowable period, provided there is a reasonable explanation.

“(2) Any further loss or damage accruing to the automobile directly or indirectly from a failure to protect it as required under sub-condition (1) of this condition is not recoverable under this contract.”

When the insured fails to take reasonable steps to protect the automobile from loss, the insurer may deny payment on that portion of the damage which could have been prevented. For example, if the automobile is not removed from the accident site, theft and vandalism losses tend to occur.

Moving the vehicle could likely be within the insured’s ability, which means that any theft or vandalism losses could have reasonably been prevented. Therefore, those losses will not be paid by the insurer.

“(3) No repairs, other than those that are immediately necessary for the protection of the automobile from further loss or damage, shall be undertaken and no physical evidence of the loss or damage shall be removed:

(a) without the consent of the insurer; or

(b) until the insurer has had a reasonable time to make the examination for which provision is made in statutory condition 8.”

The insured is authorized to make repairs which are “immediately necessary” for the protection of the automobile. For example, the insured is authorized to replace a tire damaged in the accident to move the automobile to a safe location. In all other cases, repair cannot be undertaken without the insurer’s permission.

9.3.8.8.6.1 Examination of Insured

“(4) Insureds shall submit to examination under oath at such reasonable time and place as is designated by the insurer and shall produce all documents that relate to the matters in question and permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.”

This right is important if the insurer suspects the insured may be attempting to make a fraudulent claim or when the insurer is establishing the basis for the defence of a serious liability claim.

9.3.8.8.6.2 Insurer Liable for Cash Value of Automobile

Subsection (5) explains that the insurer will pay the loss or damage according to actual cash value, minus a deduction for depreciation. Factors considered in determining the amount of depreciation include:

• Exterior paint, trim, and condition.

• Mechanical condition.

• Mileage.

• Interior upholstery and trim.

• Equipment and accessories.

• Tires.

• Any other information that affects the automobile’s value.

The insurer’s liability for obsolete or out-of-stock parts is limited to the value of that part at the time of loss or damage, not exceeding the manufacturer’s latest list price.

9.3.8.8.6.3 Repairing, Rebuilding, or Replacing Property Damaged or Lost

Subsection (6) explains that the insurer may repair, rebuild, or replace the property damaged or lost (instead of making payment) if it gives written notice of its intention to do so within seven days after the receipt of the proof of loss. There is an exception to this Statutory Condition when an appraisal has been made.

The insurer always has the option of making settlement through repair or replacement instead of paying money. When the insurer elects to repair or replace, it must advise the insured no later than seven days after the insurer has received the proof of loss. If the insured has not received notice of the intentions of the insurer within that period, they are entitled to be paid on a cash settlement basis.

If the insurer decides to repair the automobile after an accident, the insurer may, but does not have to, use new parts provided by the original equipment manufacturer. It is important to note that the insurer has the right to use rebuilt or refurbished and non-original (after-market) parts, provided these parts are of a like kind and quality of the parts which they are to replace.

Most physical damage claims are settled without dispute. However, if the insured and insurer disagree on the nature and extent of the repairs and replacements required, their adequacy, or the amounts payable, the Insurance Act provides that these questions will be determined by appraisal. Either party may request that an appraisal be provided. Details about the appraisal process can be found in the Insurance Act.

9.3.8.8.6.4 No Abandonment; Salvage

“(7) There can be no abandonment of the automobile to the insurer without the insurer’s consent. If the insurer exercises the option to replace the automobile or pays the actual cash value of the automobile, the salvage, if any, shall vest in the insurer.”

Subsection (7) means that the ownership and responsibility for the automobile after a loss remains with the insured, even when it is apparent the loss is a total loss. When the automobile is replaced or the full actual cash value is paid by the insurer, the salvage is the property of the insurer. This prevents insureds from profiting from their loss. However, this does not prevent the insured from negotiating the purchase of the wreck as a part of the final settlement.

9.3.8.8.7 Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit

Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit requires the insured to send the notice referenced in Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property and Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile within seven days of the incident. If the insured is unable to provide notice within seven days because of incapacity (for example, if they are seriously injured in the accident), the notice must be given as soon as possible.

9.3.8.8.8 Statutory Condition 8: Inspection of Automobile

“The insured shall permit the insurer at all reasonable times to inspect the automobile and its equipment.”

The insurer has the right to inspect the automobile “at all reasonable times.” This allows the insurer to confirm that the automobile for which coverage is being claimed is one which is insured by the policy. Also, such inspection helps to verify the extent of the damage caused to the automobile.

9.3.8.8.9 Statutory Condition 9: Time and Manner of Payment of Insurance Money

Any payment that the insurer is liable for under the contract must be made within 60 days after receipt of the proof of loss, provided no appraisal has taken place. If an appraisal has taken place, the insurer is liable to make payment within 15 days of the appraisal. This allows the insurer a reasonable amount of time to investigate and process the claim. If the insurer refuses to pay the claim, it must promptly inform the insured in writing, stating the reasons for not paying the claim.

The insured may not commence an action against the insurer until they have complied with the requirements of Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property and Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. If an action is brought against the insurer, such action must be commenced either (1) within one year after the date of loss for recovery of loss or damage to the automobile or its contents or (2) within two years after the cause of action arose for loss or damage to persons or other property.

9.3.8.8.10 Statutory Condition 10: Who May Give Notice and Proofs of Claim

Notice and proofs of claim may be given and made by the agent of the insured if the insured is absent or unable to do so, providing the absence is satisfactorily accounted for. Alternatively, if the insured refuses to do so, a claim may be made by a person to whom any part of the insurance money is payable. There may be occasions when insureds are unable to give notice of loss or proof of loss; it would be unfair to deny them the right to collect under the contract if they are legitimately unable to do so. In such instances, a person appointed by the insured can act on their behalf. If the insureds refuse to file notice and proof of loss, a mortgagee or other party of interest is entitled to make a claim under the policy.

Statutory Condition 10: Who May Give Notice and Proofs of Claim also specifies that all amounts payable under the policy shall be reduced by the applicable deductible amount mentioned in the policy.

9.3.8.8.11 Statutory Condition 11: Termination

Statutory Condition 11: Termination differs from most other property/casualty policies because of the legislated “three strikes” rule for non-payment of premiums. Here’s how it works:

The insured may cancel the policy at any time, subject to a short rate return of any prepaid premium. If the insurer cancels for any reason other than non-payment of premiums, cancellation is subject to a 15-day notification period beginning the day after the day of mailing of the notification, which must be sent by registered mail. This notification period can be shortened to five days if the notice is personally hand delivered.

If there is a refund due to the insured, it will be issued on a pro rata basis and should accompany the cancellation notice. If it does not accompany the cancellation notice, the insurer should issue the refund as soon as possible thereafter. If the insured still owes any premium as of the cancellation date, the premium due must be shown on the cancellation notice.

The first two cancellations for non-payment of premiums in a policy term are subject to a 30-day notification period. This period begins the day after the day of mailing of the notification, which must be sent as registered mail. If the notification was hand delivered, then the period is 10 days. To prevent the cancellation from taking effect, the insured must pay the premium owing by noon of the business day before the cancellation date in the notification.

The third cancellation for non-payment in a policy term follows the same format as any other cancellation. Notice of 15 or five days is provided, depending on the notification method used by the insurer. There is no requirement for the insurer to reinstate the policy, even if premiums owed to them are paid prior to the cancellation effective date.

Cancellations are effective at 12:01 a.m. on the date specified, which means the insured has only one minute of coverage on the cancellation date.

9.3.8.8.12 Statutory Condition 12: Notice

“Any written notice to the insurer may be delivered at, or sent by registered mail to, the chief agency or head office of the insurer in the Province. Written notice may be given to the insured named in this contract by letter personally delivered to the insured or by registered mail addressed to the insured at the insured’s latest post office address as notified to the insurer. In this condition, the expression, ‘registered’ means registered in or outside Canada.”

Statutory Condition 12: Notice outlines the rules for communications between the insured and the insurer. If an insured fails to advise the insurer of a change in residences during the policy period, they may have their coverages terminated without being aware of the termination. This is because the insurer is required to address such notice only to the “latest post office as notified to the insurer.”

9.3.8.8.13 Statutory Condition 13: Statutory Accident Benefits Protected

Statutory Condition 13: Statutory Accident Benefits Protected allows for payments as set out in the SABS (outlined in Section 9.3.8.4: Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage), even if the insured fails to comply with the Statutory Conditions.

9.3.9 Conclusion

This brings us to the end of Part 2: The Owner’s Policy (OAP 1). You’ve learned not only what each OAP 1 section provides, but also numerous examples of how the coverages are put into action.

However, not every driver in Ontario fits perfectly into the OAP 1’s thoroughly designed mold. As a broker, it’s important for you to find ways to modify what the OAP 1 has standardized. Modifications to the OAP 1 are made through endorsements, otherwise known as Ontario Policy Change Forms. We’ll now turn our attention to these.

9.3.10 Ontario Policy Change Forms

Endorsements are used to make changes (that is, add or delete coverage) to insurance policies. The endorsements used to modify the OAP 1 are known as Ontario Policy Change Forms (OPCFs). Many endorsements have been standardized over time and, like the policy wording, have been written in plain language. The content of an endorsement may not be altered in any way.

We’ve outlined all the key OPCFs in the following section. However, you should refer to the actual endorsement for more details.

Also, note the formatting in some of these endorsements:

• We’ve underlined endorsements that are currently included within the OAP 1 wording.

• We’ve bolded the OPCFs that we believe are most important for your exam — but you’ll want to be familiar with all the OPCFs listed here.

If these look intimidating, don’t worry: it’s normal to need a bit of time to learn what each OPCF is and how it modifies the OAP 1. But they’ll serve you well when you’re serving your clients!

9.3.10.1 OPCF 2: Providing Coverage When Named Persons Drive Other Automobiles

OPCF 2: Providing Coverage When Named Persons Drive Other Automobiles extends the coverage in Section 2.2.3: Other Automobiles to persons named in the endorsement. Insureds can use this endorsement to prevent a shortfall in coverage, as OAP 1 limits these coverages specifically to the named insured and their spouse.

9.3.10.2 OPCF 3: Drive Government Automobiles

OPCF 3: Drive Government Automobiles provides coverage for a person driving a vehicle owned by the Government of Canada or any province or territory of Canada. Government vehicles are exempt from the mandatory insurance requirements.

9.3.10.3 OPCF 4A: Permission to Carry Explosives

OPCF 4A: Permission to Carry Explosives provides coverage to carry specified explosives. Normally, the OAP 1 specifically excludes coverage when the vehicle is used for such purposes.

9.3.10.4 OPCF 4B: Permission to Carry Radioactive Material

Similar to OPCF 4A: Permission to Carry Explosives, OPCF 4B: Permission to Carry Radioactive Material grants permission to carry specified radioactive material.

9.3.10.5 OPCF 5: Permission to Rent or Lease Automobiles and Extending Coverage to Specified Lessee(s)

OPCF 5: Permission to Rent or Lease Automobiles and Extending Coverage to Specified Lessee(s) provides coverage to the lessee as if the lessee were the named insured, and to every other person who uses or operates the automobile with the lessee’s consent.

This is a very important change to the policy wording; normally, only the registered owner should be the named insured. It is a lengthy endorsement that essentially changes all references within the policy from “you” to “the lessee.”

9.3.10.6 OPCF 5C: Permission to Rent or Lease

OPCF 5C: Permission to Rent or Lease gives the lessor permission to lease the automobile to the applicant. The insurer agrees to indemnify the lessee and every person who, with the lessee’s consent, drives the automobile. OPCF 5C: Permission to Rent or Lease is for short-term leases only: the automobile cannot be leased or rented for more than 30 days to any one person.

9.3.10.7 OPCF 5D: Conversion Coverage (Rented or Leased Automobiles)

OPCF 5D: Conversion Coverage (Rented or Leased Automobiles) is used for vehicles that are rented or leased. Remember, under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional), that the insurance company will not pay a claim resulting from a dishonest claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement except a lease.

9.3.10.8 OPCF 6A: Permission to Carry Paying Passengers

OPCF 6A: Permission to Carry Paying Passengers permits carrying passengers for compensation.

9.3.10.9 OPCF 6B: School Bus

OPCF 6B: School Bus permits carrying passengers for compensation for school purposes that would otherwise be excluded under Section 1.8.1: General Exclusion.

9.3.10.10 OPCF 6C: Public Passenger Vehicles

OPCF 6C: Public Passenger Vehicles permits carrying passengers for compensation or hire and sets out limits of liability that are available.

9.3.10.11 OPCF 6D: Driving Training School

OPCF 6D: Driving Training School permits carrying passengers for compensation or hire, but for driver training school purposes only.

9.3.10.12 OPCF 6F: Public Passenger Vehicles — Combined Limits

OPCF 6F: Public Passenger Vehicles — Combined Limits permits carrying passengers for compensation or hire only.

9.3.10.13 OPCF 7: Separate Limits

OPCF 7: Separate Limits separates and specifies the limits under Section 3: Liability Coverage.

9.3.10.14 OPCF 8: Property Damage Reimbursement

OPCF 8: Property Damage Reimbursement makes the insured responsible for part or all of any loss or damage to other people’s property covered under Section 3: Liability Coverage.

9.3.10.15 OPCF 9: Marine Use Excluded

OPCF 9: Marine Use Excluded excludes loss or damage occurring while the automobile is on or in water or during the launching or landing process.

9.3.10.16 OPCF 13C: Restricting Glass Coverage

OPCF 13C: Restricting Glass Coverage restricts the coverage for glass damage to losses caused by perils listed in the endorsement.

9.3.10.17 OPCF 16: Suspension of Coverage

OPCF 16: Suspension of Coverage suspends certain coverages for a specific period of time (for example, suspend coverage during the winter months if the vehicle will not be driven).

Note: You’ll want to know this one well, because you’ll often be asked about it!

9.3.10.18 OPCF 17: Reinstatement of Coverage

As the name implies, OPCF 17: Reinstatement of Coverage reverses the suspension of OPCF 16: Suspension of Coverage and restores coverage.

9.3.10.19 OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages

OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages specifies that the insurer shall not be liable under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) for any more than the actual cash value of the insured vehicle or the amount specified under this endorsement, whichever is less.

This endorsement could be used on high-value vehicles, vans, motor homes, ATVs, snowmobiles, etc.

Note: It’s important to learn the difference between OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages and OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles.

9.3.10.20 OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles

OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles is in reference to Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) and allows a described automobile to be insured on a valued basis. This could be used to insure classic, custom, or antique vehicles, etc.

Note: It’s important to learn the difference between OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages and OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles.

9.3.10.21 OPCF 20: Coverage for Transportation Replacement

OPCF 20: Coverage for Transportation Replacement expands on Section 7.4.4: Loss of Use Due to Theft and provides replacement transportation for any insured loss under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) that exceeds the deductible amount for any one claim.

It reimburses the insured for reasonable expenses incurred because of the loss of use of the insured automobile. These expenses could include the rental of a substitute vehicle or the costs of taxis or public transportation. Coverage is limited in some cases to a stated amount per day and a maximum amount per occurrence. The limit of coverage can differ with each company.

9.3.10.22 OPCF 21A: Monthly Reporting Basis Fleet (Applicable to Ontario Licensed Automobiles)

OPCF 21A: Monthly Reporting Basis Fleet (Applicable to Ontario Licensed Automobiles) provides coverage for vehicles that are leased for a period of more than 30 days. Vehicles must be listed and statements of receipts or mileage (or other agreed means of rating) must be submitted to the insurer on a monthly basis.

9.3.10.23 OPCF 21B: Blanket Fleet Coverage for Ontario Licensed Automobiles

OPCF 21B: Blanket Fleet Coverage for Ontario Licensed Automobiles is used to insure automobile fleets and provides another method to identify what automobiles are covered.

9.3.10.24 OPCF 22: Damage to Property of Passengers

OPCF 22: Damage to Property of Passengers provides coverage to the property of passengers as if it belonged to the insured.

9.3.10.25 OPCF 23A: Lienholder Protection

OPCF 23A: Lienholder Protection provides protection for the lienholder’s interest in the insured vehicle. If there is a claim for loss or damage to the described automobile in which the lienholder has an interest, and the claim is settled in the form of a payment instead of a repair or replacement, the payment will be made jointly to the insured and the lienholder.

The lienholder is also protected through notification of any deletion of physical damage coverages or of any cancellation of the policy by the insurer.

9.3.10.26 OPCF 23B: Mortgage (Broad Form)

OPCF 23B: Mortgage (Broad Form) provides a greater measure of protection for the lienholder or mortgagee than OPCF 23A.

9.3.10.27 OPCF 24: Fire Apparatus

OPCF 24: Fire Apparatus eliminates the insurer’s liability for loss or damage to firefighting, salvage, or rescue equipment removed from the insured vehicle at the location of a fire.

9.3.10.28 OPCF 25A: Alteration

OPCF 25A: Alteration covers a wide variety of possible changes to the policy that are indicated in the appropriate spaces.

9.3.10.29 OPCF 27: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) and Providing Other Coverages When Insured Persons Drive Other Automobiles

OPCF 27: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) and Providing Other Coverages When Insured Persons Drive Other Automobiles extends coverage for damage to a non-owned automobile (including its equipment) resulting from the care, custody, or control of the non-owned automobile by an insured person and persons named in the endorsement (for example, a rental vehicle).

Note: It is important to understand the full coverage provided in this endorsement.

9.3.10.30 OPCF 27B: Business Operations — Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) in the Insured’s Care, Custody, or Control

OPCF 27B: Business Operations — Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) in the Insured’s Care, Custody, or Control is designed for commercial clients who have automobiles belonging to others in their care, custody, or control.

9.3.10.31 OPCF 28: Reducing Coverage for Named Persons

OPCF 28: Reducing Coverage for Named Persons reduces coverage, limits of liability, and loss or damage for specified named persons.

9.3.10.32 OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver

OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver allows for specific individuals to be excluded from coverage under the automobile policy, other than for certain accident benefits coverages. The excluded driver must sign this endorsement.

9.3.10.33 OPCF 29: Additional Coverage for Named Persons(s)

OPCF 29: Additional Coverage for Named Persons(s) extends coverage to allow specifically named person(s) to operate the insured vehicle.

9.3.10.34 OPCF 30: Removing Coverage for Attached Machinery

OPCF 30: Removing Coverage for Attached Machinery means an insurer will not be liable under Section 3: Liability Coverage and Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage for loss or damage arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of specified machinery, apparatus, or its equipment, mounted or attached to the automobile.

The insured may purchase a commercial general liability policy to cover this exposure.

9.3.10.35 OPCF 31: Non-Owned Equipment

OPCF 31: Non-Owned Equipment extends coverage to equipment not owned by the insured, but normally attached to the automobile.

9.3.10.36 OPCF 32: Use of Recreational Vehicles by Unlicensed Operators

OPCF 32: Use of Recreational Vehicles by Unlicensed Operators defines “recreational vehicles” as including snowmobiles, trail bikes, mini- automobiles, motor scooters, minicycles, snow planes, motorized toboggans, mopeds, and motor-assisted vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, dune buggies, or similar vehicles. It waives compliance with Statutory Condition 4(1) of the policy, which prohibits the insured, or anyone with the permission of the insured, from operating the insured vehicle unless authorized by law.

As a result, OPCF 32: Use of Recreational Vehicles by Unlicensed Operators would allow someone under the age of 16 to be insured while operating such a vehicle off a public highway.

9.3.10.37 OPCF 35: Coverage for Emergency Road Service

OPCF 35: Coverage for Emergency Road Service provides reimbursement for up to $50 for emergency services each time the insured vehicle is disabled.

9.3.10.38 OPCF 38: Agreed Limit for Automobile Electronic Accessories and Equipment

OPCF 38: Agreed Limit for Automobile Electronic Accessories and Equipment limits the amount the insurer will pay for loss or damage to automobile electronic accessories and equipment other than factory-installed equipment to agreed amounts. This came into effect January 1, 2001.

9.3.10.39 OPCF 40: Fire Deductible

OPCF 40: Fire Deductible makes losses caused by fire or theft of the entire automobile subject to a deductible, if they are not already subject to one. This endorsement is normally added to recreational vehicles.

9.3.10.40 OPCF 43: Removing Depreciation Deduction

OPCF 43: Removing Depreciation Deduction means that, in the event of loss or damage to the insured automobile by an insured peril, the insurer agrees not to deduct for depreciation. The amount payable is limited to the lesser of: (1) the actual purchase price of the vehicle and its equipment, (2) the manufacturer’s suggested list price at the time of original purchase, or (3) the cost to replace the automobile with a new automobile of the same make and model, similarly equipped.

The insured must be the original purchaser of the automobile.

9.3.10.41 OPCF 43A: Removing Depreciation Deduction for Specified Lessee(s)

OPCF 43A: Removing Depreciation Deduction for Specified Lessee(s) removes the insurer’s right to deduct depreciation when settling a claim for loss or damage similar to OPCF 43: Removing Depreciation Deduction.

9.3.10.42 OPCF 44R: Family Protection Endorsement

OPCF 44R: Family Protection Endorsement indemnifies an eligible claimant for the amount that they are legally entitled to recover from an inadequately insured or uninsured motorist as compensatory damages for bodily injury to or death of an insured person arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile.

This endorsement exists on almost every policy sold in Ontario. The minimum limit of liability coverage in the province is $200,000, but almost anyone with an insurance policy will have coverage for an amount greater than the minimum (either $500,000 or $1,000,000). The endorsement is designed to provide the same level of protection to the insured and their family as the insured has provided to the public at large, with the liability limit shown on the insured’s policy.

If the insured is struck by an underinsured motorist carrying only $200,000 liability coverage, and the insured’s policy provides coverage up to $1,000,000 for legal liability, OPCF 44R: Family Protection Endorsement could be used to pay up to $800,000 — the difference between the insured’s limit of liability and the limit of liability on the underinsured motorist’s policy.

If the insured suffers a threshold injury in the above-mentioned collision and sues the underinsured motorist for $600,000, the underinsured motorist’s policy will pay only $200,000. Without this endorsement, that would be all the insured could recover. With this endorsement on the policy, the insured would collect the remaining $400,000, as if it were the underinsured motorist’s liability policy.

This endorsement can be used to pay up to the difference between an underinsured motorist’s policy and the insured’s policy liability limits for any incident of a similar nature.

This endorsement will also top up the amount recoverable under these circumstances when only $200,000 is recoverable under Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage, or if the absolute liability provision applies due to the illegal or prohibited actions of the at-fault motorist.

9.3.10.43 OPCF 46: Pre-determined Income from Self-Employment Agreement

OPCF 46: Pre-determined Income from Self-Employment Agreement allows the insured and insurer to come to a pre-arranged agreement on what the insured’s annual self-employment income will be for the purposes of determining accident benefits.

9.3.10.44 OPCF 47: Agreement Not to Rely on SABS Priority of Payment Rules

If a client purchases the mandatory coverages, the insurer is required to issue an OPCF 47: Agreement Not to Rely on SABS Priority of Payment Rules at no charge. This endorsement allows the insured to claim Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage (including optional benefits) provided by the policy, regardless of the priority of payment rules in Section 268 of the Insurance Act.

9.3.10.45 OPCF 48: Added Coverage to Offset Tort Deductibles

Under OPCF 48: Added Coverage to Offset Tort Deductibles, the insurer agrees to indemnify the insured for $10,000 for an insured person and $5,000 for a claimant under the Family Law Act for non-pecuniary claims (pain and suffering).

9.3.10.46 OPCF 49: Agreement Not to Recover for Loss or Damage from an Automobile Collision (for OAP 1)

This endorsement, added in 2024 by the Ontario Government, allows drivers who own their vehicle outright to opt out of the Direct Compensation for Property Damage (DCPD) coverage. If the described vehicle is damaged in a collision, the loss will not be compensated, even if they are not at fault. Owners will not be compensated by this insurance policy, or by anyone else, including anyone at fault for causing the damage, or their insurance company. In addition, there is no coverage under Subsection 7.1.2, C -- Collision or Upset, or 7.1.2, D -- All Perils with respect to the vehicle(s) listed on the form.

9.4.1 Facility Association

9.4.1.1 Overview

The Facility Association (FA) is an organization of Canadian insurers who co-operate to provide insurance for vehicle owners and/or drivers who, without this arrangement, would have difficulty obtaining insurance. Drivers that require the FA market typically have poor driving records (such as impaired driving convictions) or too many accidents or claims.

However, the FA has never issued a single insurance policy — that’s because it is not a licensed insurer. The existence of the FA allows individual insurers to avoid accepting undesirable business, while at the same time ensuring that legislated compulsory automobile insurance requirements are met by all drivers/vehicle owners. When individual insurers choose not to insure a risk, they provide the insurance at their collective cost through the FA. The FA is the administrator of this collective mechanism.

To understand how the FA works, it is necessary to understand how private/voluntary market insurers work differently from residual risk market insurers.

Voluntary market insurers have a whole array of insurance rates, which are linked to a whole array of underwriting criteria (for example, type of vehicle, type of use, geographic location, number of drivers, claims history, driving record, etc.). When someone needs automobile insurance, usually a broker (or agent) determines how the person fits into the array of underwriting criteria for the voluntary market insurers represented by the broker’s office.

If the applicant does not fit within the voluntary market underwriting criteria, they must still be provided with an insurance policy under the requirements of the Insurance Act. The broker then needs to look at residual risk market insurers, such as the FA.

The broker then determines how the driver fits into a separate array of FA rate categories and sends the application to an FA servicing carrier for a policy to be issued. That policy is essentially underwritten by all the insurers collectively. The broker collects the annual premium (or more likely, some portion thereof) and the servicing carrier issues a policy.

9.4.1.2 Organization Structure

The FA is an unincorporated association of property and casualty insurance companies. Since it is not a licensed insurance company, it does not have an insurance charter.

Because the FA is not an insurance company, it must contract members to underwrite insurance applications and to adjust claims. It appoints a limited number of members, known as servicing carriers, to conduct its business. The servicing carriers are paid a fee to perform this service, and they are expected to follow the rules of the FA as set out in its Plan of Operation and servicing carrier contract.

The servicing carrier must adjust claims in an efficient and practical manner following the claims guidelines. Certain underwriting expenses (for example, driver record abstracts) and certain claims expenses incurred by servicing carriers are reimbursed. The eligible expenses are laid out in the FA’s Plan of Operation and the Accounting and Statistical Manual.

Audits of each servicing carrier are conducted biannually to ensure proper compliance with FA rules, regulations, and procedures. These audits investigate the underwriting policy issuance operations and the claims operations of the servicing carriers.

The FA provides guidance to the servicing carriers on matters such as how to interpret the rules of the manuals. The servicing carriers also sit on several FA committees, such as its Rates and Rules Committee, Actuarial Committee, Claims Committee, and Accounting Committee, along with non-servicing carrier members.

The FA’s management prepares the organization’s financial statements. Its external auditors audit these statements.

The FA issues a monthly Participation Report to its members, who are required to enter the information into their books. There is no flow of any information (for example, underwriting, claims, financial, or system) from member companies that are not servicing carriers to the FA.

The FA has a limited relationship with brokers. Instead, a contract is set up between the FA, the servicing carrier, and the broker. Here’s how it works:

• The servicing carrier does all the administration.

• The broker contacts the servicing carrier if they need guidance with a policy. Occasionally, a broker may contact the FA if they want a change in servicing carrier, or if they do not agree with what a servicing carrier is stating — but normally, they rely on the servicing carriers for functions.

• The servicing carrier looks after the accounting functions, including paying the commissions or service fees to the brokers.

9.4.1.3 Policy Issuance and Claim Settlement

The FA sends blank insurance applications to the servicing carriers, who in turn send them to the brokers. Each application form is numbered in sequence, providing control in the distribution process. The FA is never involved with and does not receive completed applications, other than for auditing purposes.

The servicing carrier underwrites the applications, produces the documentation (policies), and distributes them directly to the brokers. The FA is not involved in policy processing and does not receive completed policies.

Servicing carriers, on behalf of the FA, also distribute the FA Manual of Rules and Rates to all brokers and agents. This manual provides detailed instructions and rules for determining how a risk is to be classified and how to calculate premiums, including what surcharges are to be applied. The Rates and Rules Committee, which consists of member company volunteers, develops the rules in the manual.

The rate portion of the manual contains the actual premiums by classification, vehicle type, industry limits and deductibles, and special surcharges and discounts. These rates are first developed by the FA’s consulting actuary, then reviewed by the Rates and Rules Committee, approved by the FA Board of Directors, and submitted to the appropriate provincial regulatory body for review and approval.

The servicing carrier makes claims payments on FA policies. Claims payments are made using FA cheques from the bank account set up by the FA for that carrier.

9.4.1.4 The Broker’s Role

After determining the client’s needs, the broker will survey the various insurance companies they represent to see if there is a market where they can place their client, at the best price and terms that can be negotiated with the insurer. (It’s worth noting that there may be some voluntary markets that may write a risk that others will not. Since no single broker represents all the companies in the marketplace, some brokers may have a market for a risk that others do not.)

If the broker cannot obtain a voluntary market insurer, then they will have no option but to place the insured through the FA. FA servicing carriers do not provide quotes, so the broker must complete the application, following the rules in the Manual of Rules and Rates. All brokers use the same manual. The manual is complex, which serves to ensure all insureds are treated fairly and consistently. Additionally, to qualify the applicant, the broker must include a rejection letter from a voluntary market insurer with the application. The application is then submitted to the broker’s designated servicing carrier.

In Ontario, there are rules and procedures for retention of business in the FA — that is, automatically removing risks that have improved and may qualify for the voluntary market. Outside Ontario, there are no such rules. Therefore, some risks that could get voluntary market coverage may stay in the FA if the broker does not check all its markets at renewal.

The FA commission rate is an incentive to remove risks. It is generally lower than the commission rate for the voluntary market, especially considering special commissions and bonuses that are offered in the voluntary market (for example, contingent profit commission). Furthermore, the FA does not offer any special commission to switch portfolios of business, nor does it offer any overriding commission to brokers for any special work they perform that would usually be completed by the insurer.

FA policies are more difficult to administer than voluntary market policies. The FA insists on signed and fully completed applications, including binder numbers and completion of a binder register. FA policies also require completion of additional forms for motorcycles, as well as commercial, garage, and public vehicles, which is more time consuming than handling voluntary market business — and all at a lower commission rate than the voluntary market.

9.4.2 Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario

As you’ll remember from Section 3.2.2: Provincial Supervision, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) protects the interests of consumers and pension plan members. It enforces sound business practices while encouraging a strong, competitive industry.

The FSRA is the Ontario government regulator of insurance companies, pensions, credit unions, Caisses Populaires, co-operatives, loan and trust companies, insurance agents and adjusters, and mortgage brokers. Its activities are as follows:

• Consumer complaints resolution.

• Automobile insurance driver profiles and rates review.

• Automobile insurance accident benefits dispute resolution.

• Mediation.

• Arbitration.

• Pension plans.

• Licensing.

• Regulation and enforcement.

• Financial Services Tribunal.

Let’s take a look at the FSRA activities that relate to automobile insurance.

9.4.2.1 Consumer Complaints Resolution

The FSRA’s Market Conduct Division offers consumers a last-stop forum to resolve complaints with insurance companies in Ontario. This department encourages insurance companies to resolve complaints directly with the consumer. If consumers are unable to resolve their complaint with the insurance company, the Market Conduct Division will assist consumers and make recommendations to the Superintendent of Financial Services if it appears that the insurer has engaged in unlawful business practices.

If a consumer has a complaint, the complaints process is as follows:

1) The consumer makes a complaint to the insurance company.

2) If the company is unable to resolve the complaint, the consumer will request a letter from the company stating its final position.

3) The consumer will write to the Market Conduct Division.

4) The Market Conduct Division will review the written complaint.

9.4.2.2 Driver Profiles and Rates Review

The FSRA monitors both the premium rates and driver classification systems used by insurance companies in Ontario. The insurance companies must file any proposed changes to their rates and driver classification systems for approval.

9.4.2.2.1 Credit Information

Credit information means information about a person’s creditworthiness. It includes information about, or derived in whole or in part from, the person’s credit score, including their credit-based insurance score, credit rating, occupation, previous places of residence, number of dependants, educational or professional qualifications, current or previous places of employment, estimated income, outstanding debt obligations, past debt payment history, cost of living obligations, and assets.

The list of unfair and deceptive acts or practices, as outlined in Regulation 7/00 of the Insurance Act, came into effect on September 1, 2010. Under this Regulation, Section 2(1)4 states that an insurer is prohibited to use credit information for any aspects of automobile insurance, including:

• Processing or responding to requests for a quotation.

• Processing or responding to requests for an application.

• Processing or responding to completed and signed applications.

• Processing offers to renew existing policies.

Insurers are also prohibited from using unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as defined in Regulation 7/00, to refuse or limit the amount in a statutory accident benefit claim.

9.4.2.3 Accident Benefits Dispute Resolution

The FSRA’s dispute resolution process helps consumers and insurance companies settle accident benefit claims.

9.4.2.4 Mediation

If there is a dispute over accident benefits, the parties must mediate their claim through the FSRA’s mediation department.

9.4.2.5 Arbitration

Arbitration is an alternative to court. It involves file review, pre-hearings, settlement discussions, and neutral discussions.

9.4.2.5.1 Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund

The law guarantees Ontario residents who are involved in an automobile accident the ability to make a claim to receive accident benefits or sue the at-fault driver for compensation. Individuals who are not protected by any automobile insurance policy can apply to receive accident benefits from the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (MVACF).

In addition, a lawsuit may be filed against the uninsured driver and owner of the at-fault vehicle. The MVACF provides accident benefits and liability limits of $200,000 plus some legal expenses. The MVACF will attempt to recover the amount paid out by the fund from the at-fault uninsured driver.

9.4.2.6 Licensing

The FSRA’s licensing department handles the licensing of agents, insurance companies, and mortgage brokers.

Note: The next four sections of this chapter involve the commercial use of vehicles. There will be more discussion on commercial auto in Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance.

9.4.3 OAP 2 (Driver’s Policy)

When an individual drives a vehicle belonging to another person and does not have an automobile insurance policy which could extend to provide the required coverage for borrowed vehicles, or when there is uncertainty whether the owner of the vehicle has insurance, the OAP 2 (known as Driver’s Policy) is available to provide coverage. However, since these circumstances are rare, there are relatively few OAP 2s issued.

An automobile is considered non-owned in the following situations:

• The insured is personally in control of the automobile as the driver or occupant in an automobile:

- Not owned by the driver.

- Not registered in the driver’s name.

• The automobile is not in operation by, but is in the personal care, custody, or control of the insured.

• An “automobile” includes a trailer. An automobile with a trailer is considered to be one vehicle under OAP 1, Section 1: Introduction, Section 2: What Automobiles Are Covered? and Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage, and as separate vehicles under Section 3: Liability Coverage, including deductibles.

An OAP 2 may be purchased (probably in a residual risk market, such as the FA) by a driver who is excluded under OAP 1, OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver. OAP 2s are also frequently issued to facilitate filing proof of financial responsibility that the applicant may require to obtain a valid driver’s license.

The OAP 2 is organized in a similar manner to OAP 1. It contains the following:

• Section 1: Third Party Liability.

• Section 2: Accident Benefits.

• Section 3: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobiles.

• Section 4: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 5: General Provisions, Definitions and Exclusions.

• Section 6: Statutory Conditions.

The coverages under the OAP 2 match those of the OAP 1 except, of course, that the OAP 2 deals with coverages for vehicles not owned by the insured.

Note: Under OAP 2, Section 3: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobiles of the Driver’s Policy, in order for Coverage A: Specified Perils, Coverage B: Comprehensive, Coverage C: Collision or Upset, or Coverage D: All Perils to apply, there must be liability imposed by law on the insured or liability assumed under an agreement for loss or damage to the non-owned automobile.

9.4.3.1 Rating

The insurer will need to know the full details of the type of vehicles likely to be driven and their type of use, as if liability for damage is assumed by agreement. The insurer will then rate the policy for the highest exposure.

The OAP 2 is purchased by businesses which operate or deal in the sale, repair, detailing, storage, parking, or servicing of automobiles in any fashion. The basic structure of the policy is very similar to the OAP 1. It is designed to cover the liability, accident benefits, uninsured automobile, and DCPD exposures of owners, active partners, and full-time employees when driving automobiles that are registered in the business’s name.

9.4.4 OAP 4 (Garage Policy)

The OAP 4, often referred to as the Garage Policy, is designed for businesses that operate clients’ vehicles. Despite its name, it is not only for automotive repair garages, but for any business that operates other people’s vehicles, such as hotels or restaurants with valet/concierge services.

In this section, we will refer to garages only to keep things simple. The major difference between the OAP 1 and the OAP 4 is the policies’ treatment of damage to automobiles. The OAP 4 is designed for businesses relating to automobiles. It provides coverage for both owned and non-owned automobiles for loss or damage that occurs while being operated by an owner, active partner, or full-time employee. Vehicles belonging to the business’s customers would be considered non-owned automobiles (more on this in Section 10.8: Commercial Automobile & the Sharing Economy).

A business is responsible for a customer’s vehicle while it is in the care, custody, and control of the business. The customer’s OAP 1 will not respond to damage caused by a garage employee, because this damage is specifically excluded under that policy (see Section 1.8.4: Garage Workers Not Covered). The non-owned automobile coverage available under the OAP 4 fills this gap.

The OAP 4 consists of the following sections:

• Section 1: Third Party Liability.

• Section 2: Accident Benefits.

• Section 3: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 4: Direct Compensation – Property Damage.

• Section 5: Loss or Damage to Owned Automobiles.

• Section 6: Liability for Damage to a Customer’s Automobile While in the Care, Custody or Control of the insured.

• Section 7: General Provisions, Definitions and Exclusions.

• Section 8: Statutory Conditions.

9.4.5 Standard Policy Forms

Standard Policy Forms (SPFs) are legislated and administered by the Superintendent of Insurance to protect the insuring public. All provincially licensed insurance companies who issue automobile insurance in Ontario must use these approved forms (although their underwriting rules of acceptance and rating may be different).

Some of the most common Standard Policy Forms (SPFs) are described next.

9.4.5.1 SPF 6: Standard Non-Owned Automobile Policy

SPF 6: Standard Non-Owned Automobile Policy has been designed to meet the needs of employers who may be held responsible for damages caused by employees operating their own (or others’) vehicles in the course of regular business. The coverage is normally sold to anyone operating a business where there can be regular or occasional use of vehicles that the business does not own.

This policy covers the insured, who is the employer, as well as every partner, officer, or employee if they drive a non-owned automobile in the business of the employer on the policy. These persons are not covered if the automobile is owned by or licensed in the name of the insured, the person driving, or a resident of the dwelling premises of the insured or the driver.

Coverage applies to automobiles not owned by the insured. The automobiles may be owned by the employees, rented or leased by the insured, or operated under contract for the insured.

9.4.5.2 SPF 7: Excess Automobile Policy

SPF 7: Excess Automobile Policy is used in provinces with government-run automobile insurance policies. This is an extension policy to provide additional or excess coverage for liability and accident benefits, over and above the government’s primary insurance policy.

The government policy always pays first, and that coverage must be exhausted before SPF 7: Excess Automobile Policy will respond. This policy often provides coverage to pay the deductibles on the standard government policies for physical damage to the automobile.

9.4.5.3 SPF 8: Lessor’s Contingent Automobile Policy

SPF 8: Lessor’s Contingent Automobile Policy provides coverage on a contingency basis for businesses that lease vehicles on a long-term basis. Coverage is applied secondary to coverage already in place on the vehicle (which the lessee is responsible for purchasing).

If the lessee has not purchased the required insurance, or has somehow violated a policy condition and therefore forfeited the coverage, SPF 8: Lessor’s Contingent Automobile Policy will respond and pay the lessor their interest in the vehicle and/or its loss or damage.

9.5 CONCLUSION

You’ve reached the end of our chapter on automobile insurance in Ontario. Yes, it’s a lot of information to take in, but we are also not done with it just yet! In Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance, we will extend this discussion slightly by introducing how auto insurance works for commercial clients and those in the sharing economy.

Unfortunately, automobile accidents occur every day, and policies such as the OAP 1, OAP 2, and OAP 4 are necessarily long and complex to meet the needs of many different drivers. But remember: the information here is vital for you to know, both for the RIBO Level 1 exam and throughout your work in a brokerage. The next time you’re driving or riding in a car, you can think about Ontario’s simple, but also complex, automobile insurance structure.
