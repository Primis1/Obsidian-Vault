✓ Explain the importance of the Insurance Act’s controls on property policy wordings.

✓ Describe the policy wordings for conditions, exclusions, and basis of claims payments.

✓ Determine the appropriate property insurance policy for various risks based on coverage.

✓ Name common extensions and endorsements to a standard property insurance policy.

✓ Identify the types of water or flood damage property owners face.

7.1 INTRODUCTION

Personal property is one of the key lines of insurance. This chapter will introduce you to the different types of coverages that fall under “comprehensive” policies, and the way these policies have been developed to meet the needs of Canadians. We’ll be using the Comprehensive Homeowner, Tenant, Condominium Unit Owner Package Policy (which we’ll refer to as the “Homeowner Policy”) as a framework to learn about these coverages, exclusions, and endorsements.

7.2 BACKGROUND ON URBAN DEVELOPMENT

Housing types and structures in Canada have changed dramatically over the last 40 years. Historically, cities and towns were a mixture of single- and multiple-family dwellings and low- and medium-rise apartments. As the population grew, urban centres became increasingly congested, which prompted an expansion into surrounding rural areas. This resulted in the growth of the suburban landscape, with bungalows and multi-storey residences on fairly large lots. Land was relatively cheap in a lot of areas, which meant lower housing density.

This began to change during the 1970s and 1980s, as concerns grew that we were paving over high-quality farmland. The land supply tightened, forcing developers to look at newer ways to utilize their stock of land. Governments also began a program of infilling older urban areas and allowing multi-unit and multi-use buildings in formerly single-family dwelling neighbourhoods.

Building techniques changed: low-rise apartment buildings were demolished to allow for the creation of high-rise buildings and condominiums. Some cities have now reached the full extent of their boundaries, and the only way for them to meet increasing housing needs is to grow upwards.

Building construction has evolved over the last 50 years, with new products and methods coming to market at a very rapid pace. Large tracts of land can go from a flat field to occupied houses within a year. Changes in building codes have made these structures safer, more energy efficient, and, in many cases, more resistant to the changes brought on by our climate.

Image

The environmental concerns about how we use energy and treat waste — as well as the impact of weather on our housing — have had a significant impact on the input costs to build and to renovate. This has had a direct input on the values of our housing structures. Replacement costs and insurance values have increased dramatically over the last decade.

Couple this new housing with the existing stock of houses (now well over 50 years old) and we have a residential dwelling market that is as diversified as the people who live in it. Some urban areas have a mix of residential and commercial (or business) uses on the same property, with businesses taking up the main floor (for example, a storefront) and residential on the upper floors. In areas of Toronto, this has been going on for many years — but it is now spreading into many mid and small sized towns and cities. The digital economy is increasing both commercial and residential exposures within the same property as more people work from home. Infilling, intensification, multi-use, varied ownership structures, and many other changes have impacted how insurance companies respond to this changing market.

7.3 COMMERCIAL INSURANCE VS. HABITATIONAL INSURANCE

Before the 1970s, there was a clear division in most communities between commercial insurance and habitational insurance. Business was in the “business district” and homes were in the “residential district.” People went to work and came back home. The policies were structured differently to account for the different nature of these risks. Let’s compare these traditional insurance models.

7.3.1 Commercial Insurance

Commercial insurance has always been individually rated, as there are no common elements found in all commercial building structures. Though they may all have floors, walls, and roofs, their construction, use, and occupancy vary widely, which requires a more varied approach to underwriting. Except in certain cases, there is no-one-size-fits-all approach in commercial insurance. The policy will provide coverage for only those items listed at the location noted on the policy. It is highly specific.

Image

We’ll explore this topic in greater detail in Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance. (If you’d like to become proficient as a commercial lines broker, you’ll need to pursue further study to understand the complexity of the product, including when it comes to the sharing economy.)

7.3.2 Habitational Insurance

Habitational insurance works differently. Though a home can take many different forms, there are some elements that are constant to all. Most houses normally have bathrooms, kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms of various sizes. Because houses share so many common features, the insurance industry created one type of policy to cover everyone, with the ability to vary the rating and limits according to the risk (that is, the property). Homeowners who had more than the standard limits developed by rating tables could increase their limits by adding endorsements.

Image

Likewise, apartment dwellers had a relatively simple policy form based on certain constant elements found in all apartment structures. This policy provided coverage for everything at that location, subject to certain limits and exclusions. However, the explosion of condominiums has added another layer to the type of policy available. Though condominiums range from high-rise to low-rise, to townhouse to single-family dwelling, the policy form has evolved to respond to this new type of building ownership and to meet the needs of the unit owners.

In the past, insurance companies, through the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), developed separate policy forms that allowed brokers to apply the appropriate policy to the type of residential risk. Companies used these common industry forms as a basis for their own policies. Today, most companies have their own uniquely different forms, which help to give them either a competitive advantage or the ability to restrict and/or control coverages. As a broker, it is important for you to have a thorough knowledge of the individual company products (policies) you are selling, and to make accurate comparisons to meet the actual needs and expectations of your clients.

7.3.2.1 Different Housing Types

Because residential housing comes in a myriad of shapes and forms, reviewing coverages can be a confusing process.

To simplify, think of these examples:

Image

It is important to have a mental picture of one type of house, one type of apartment, and one type of condominium (and in subsequent sections, one type of secondary and seasonal dwelling). If you can readily picture these different housing forms, you’ll have clarity during the exam, especially while the clock is ticking.

7.3.2.2 Evolution of Habitational Policies

As the world evolves, so too do the policies for property coverages. The development of policy coverages reacts relatively slowly to changes in the actual physical elements in the risk. For example, the creation of condominiums resulted in a time gap between the construction, sale, and occupancy of this form of building, and the eventual standard policy form providing the appropriate coverage.

The development of the policy form succeeds (that is, follows) the creation of new building types, rather than preceding it. As the models for residential ownership and occupancy change and evolve, the policy forms providing coverage also need to change to meet those challenges. For example, we’re starting to see fractional ownership by non-related individuals of a single-family dwelling, which will challenge how we address the named insureds on a policy.

The structure of the habitational policy was derived from, and is controlled by elements of, the Insurance Act. The original policy, known as the Basic Fire Policy, provided property coverage for fire, lightning, and explosion of natural, coal, and manufactured gas. The Basic Fire Policy had been sufficient for insuring the public in the past, when indoor plumbing was new (or non-existent), heating was rudimentary, and electrical wiring was virtually non-existent. We have come a long way since then!

The Basic Fire policy evolved into the Named Perils Form (also known as the Specified Perils Form). With the advent of the All-Risk coverages, the policy evolved into the Broad Form where coverage was; All-Risk on the building, and Named Perils on the contents. It then evolved into the Comprehensive Policy Form, which is All-Risk on both Building and Contents. We will consider the Specified Perils Form for certain aspects within the Comprehensive Policy Form and for secondary and seasonal dwellings. However, our primary focus will be the Comprehensive Policy Form, which is the most commonly used form in the insurance marketplace.

7.4 COMPREHENSIVE POLICY FORMS

Every insurance company offers its own Comprehensive Policy Form. Later in this chapter, we will be using the generic Comprehensive Homeowner, Tenant, Condominium Unit Owner Package Policy as the basis for our discussion. In the Appendix section of this chapter is an example Habitational Application form provided to us by CSIO18 for information purposes only. But for now, let’s discuss Comprehensive Policy Forms in general.

While Comprehensive (or “All-Risks”) Forms provide a lot of flexibility for different insureds, one challenge they create is that insureds assume that they are covered for everything. This is not the case, and brokers must be aware of the policy limitations and exclusions.

A comprehensive habitational insurance policy comprises the declarations page and the policy attached to it. The values on the declarations page are derived from the combination of information found in the Home Evaluation Calculator and/or the Contents Limit and the application. This combination is unique and will determine the limits and premium for every policy.

The Home Evaluation Calculator is an industry tool to ensure that the proper limits for every property policy are used in the calculation of the premium. The square footage of the building and the class of construction, along with a list of other components, dictate the replacement value of the structure. The components of the calculator are continually upgraded with the latest costs of both construction and building component parts.

All Comprehensive Policy Forms contain eight common elements or characteristics with common limits and exclusions. We can then take the appropriate coverages and apply them to the Homeowner, Tenant, or Condominium Unit Owner Policies.

7.4.1 Form

We learned previously that the Homeowners Broad Form policy is a combination of the Comprehensive Policy wording for the building and outbuilding and the named perils coverage for personal property. The named perils coverage, with a few exceptions, is equivalent to the coverage provided by the basic policy form.

This Broad form policy gives the insured All-Risk coverage on the building and outbuildings, but contents will be restricted to coverage for the following: fire, lightning, explosion, smoke, falling object, impact by aircraft or land vehicle, riot, vandalism, water damage, windstorm and hail, glass breakage, theft, and electricity. If the loss is caused by a peril that is not noted, there is no coverage.

The same deductible will apply to all sections. There may be situations where the building has coverage and the contents do not.

The advantage of the Comprehensive Policy is that all sections are insured on an all-risks basis. Rather than declaring the perils that must occur for a policy to respond, a Comprehensive Policy “insures against all risks of direct physical loss or damage subject to policy conditions and exclusions.” If a peril is not shown as excluded, coverage is provided for the loss. When a client asks if a claim is covered, check the list of exclusions first to see if the peril is excluded from coverage.

7.4.2 Location

Property insurance policies contain a definition of the property they insure. For example, Homeowner Policy forms include automatic coverage for all the property within the lots lines. Under the Condominium Unit Owner and Tenant Policy forms, the dwelling or unit includes garages, outbuildings, and private approaches reserved for the policyholder’s use or occupancy only. The client must be made aware that any property beyond these limits must be declared and listed on the summary page for it to be covered.

7.4.3 Definitions

Every policy starts with a definitions page to define who and what are covered by the policy. Definitions for certain terms are uniform — that is, they do not differ between the policy forms.

7.4.4 Conditions

A condition requires the insured to do or not to do something. There are two types of conditions found in these policies:

• Statutory Conditions: These are conditions which are established by law and are legally binding to all parties of the contract. They derive from the Insurance Act and are attached to all insurance policies insuring the peril of fire. Since fire is not an excluded peril in these policies, this condition must be included in the wording. For more on Statutory Conditions, refer back to Section 5.3: Part 2: Statutory Conditions.

• Policy conditions: These are specifically developed by insurers to deal with important coverage areas.

7.4.5 Exclusions

There are two types of exclusions: property excluded and perils excluded. These items are excluded due to the higher-than-normal risk they present, and they are more properly insured on other policy forms.

The following types of property are excluded:

• Evidence of debt or title.

• Securities.

• Automobiles.

• Watercraft.

• Aircraft.

• Money.

• Other motor vehicles.

• Books of account.

• Vacant property (after more than 30 days).

The following types of perils are excluded:

• Earthquakes.

• Floods.

• Smoke due to agricultural smudging or industrial operations.

• Wear and tear or gradual deterioration.

• Rust and corrosion.

• War.

• Nuclear incident.

• Increased cost of repair or construction due to by-law enforcement.

• Sewer backup.

Insurance policies contain exclusions because losses caused by certain perils — like war or a nuclear incident — would be so catastrophic they would threaten the financial solvency of any insurance company. Some of these perils would never be automatically covered under the policy form, while others — such as floods, earthquakes, sewer backups, and repairs or construction due to by-laws — are available to clients at an additional cost. Notably, the physical location of the risk has a direct bearing on the availability of coverage and the premium charged for these coverages. For example, if one lives in a high-risk earthquake zone (such as certain areas in the Ottawa valley), they’ll pay a higher premium. And, if a dwelling is located in a known flood zone, coverage may not be available.

7.4.6 Deductible

Almost without exception, a deductible clause is included on all property policies. A deductible represents the amount the insured is required to pay for each loss before receiving any payment from the insurer.

7.4.7 Claims Payment

Until an insured submits a claim, the policy is only a promise to pay. The policy lays out the way claims are paid out to the insured to ensure they are properly indemnified for their loss. For example, the Homeowner Policy states: “The insurer will pay for the insured loss or damage up to your financial interest in the property, but not exceeding the applicable amount(s) of insurance for any loss or damage arising out of one occurrence.”

7.4.7.1 Actual Cash Value Basis

Normally, claims are based on the actual cash value (ACV) of the property in question. ACV is defined as:

“Replacement Cost minus Depreciation”

The use of depreciation in determining value is based on the principle of indemnity. When an insured uses an item they own over a period of time, they will use up some of its ‘value,’ and that amount should be deducted from the settlement.

7.4.7.2 Replacement Cost Basis

Many insurers will agree to change the basis of settlement for property from ACV to Replacement Cost (RC). This change may be in the policy itself or by separate endorsement. Even if the RC coverage is in place on the policy, the insured must comply with certain policy conditions to make a claim on that basis. This applies to both building and contents.

When settling dwelling buildings and outbuildings on an RC basis, the conditions are that the repair or replacement must be on the same site, made with similar materials, and within a reasonable time. The building occupancy must be the same as prior to the loss, and the building must have been insured to at least 80% of the RC prior to the loss. These conditions reduce a moral hazard where a building has been allowed to deteriorate and become uninhabitable. If any of these conditions are not met, payment would be reduced to the ACV.

Dwelling buildings can also be covered on a Guaranteed Replacement Cost (GRC) basis. If the GRC is specified in the declarations, the insurer will pay the actual cost of repairs or replacement, which ever is less, without deduction for depreciation, even if it is more than the amount of insurance shown, provided that:

1) The amount of insurance at inception or the most recent renewal date is not less than 100% of the RC as determined by a valuation guide acceptable to the insurer;

2) The amount of insurance has not been reduced below that amount;

3) Repair or replacement has been commenced within a reasonable time on the same location with a building of the same occupancy with materials of like kind and quality; and

4) The insured notifies the insurer within 90 days of any addition, extension, improvement, or betterment to the residence dwelling which increases its value by $10,000 or more.

In the conditions above, improvements and betterments are applicable to tenants or condominium unit owners, and are defined in the Homeowner Policy as follows:

“If you repair or replace the damaged or destroyed unit or improvements or betterments Chapter 7: Property Insurance you may choose as the basis of loss payment either the ACV determined at the date of the occurrence or the RC.

Repair or replacement must be effected with materials of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the damage. Failure to comply with the conditions of the RC will result in the claim being paid on the ACV.”

For contents, the RC coverage must be purchased by endorsement and shown on the declarations page. The conditions are that the item lost must be replaced with like kind and quality and used for the same purpose. Because of their nature, some items (such as antiques or fine art) would not be covered as normal contents on an RC basis.

7.4.7.3 Valued Basis

When insureds have property that cannot be replaced (such as original art, family jewelry, furs, antiques, and memorabilia), the insurer may agree to provide coverage on a valued basis. When there is a loss to insured property, the basis of settlement will be the value agreed to by the insured and insurer. Insurers will normally require valuation by a qualified appraiser and the item(s) will be added to the policy by a separate endorsement.

7.4.7.4 Property in Pairs and Sets

Within claims payment, it is sometimes difficult to determine what constitutes a complete indemnity. This is particularly true when settling claims on property comprising a pair, a set, or several parts, and not all the property has been destroyed. For example, an insured might file a claim for a pair of matching candlesticks or a pair of diamond earrings, where only one unit of the pair is lost or stolen. In another example, an insured might file a claim for property in parts, such as three rooms of wall-to-wall carpet, where spilled paint has damaged the carpet beyond repair in only one room.

The rules for these situations are as follows:

• Pairs and sets: Loss or damage to one item of a pair or set does not constitute loss or damage to the entire pair or set. The item not lost continues to have value, and this amount will be deducted from the amount of the claim.

• Parts: When there is loss to only one part of property which consists of several parts, the basis of settlement will be the value of the lost or damaged part, including the cost of installation. In our example, only the carpet in the one room where the damage occurred would be repaired or replaced — not the entire three rooms of carpet.

7.4.8 Standard Mortgage Clause

To purchase a home, most Canadians rely on loans from various different financial sources. The party issuing the mortgage (the mortgagee) will insist that their interest be shown on the policy to protect their interest in the event of a loss. They will request a certified copy of the policy and copies of subsequent renewals.

Mortgagees can include banks, credit unions, or individuals. The standard mortgage clause was developed so that these different types of mortgagees wouldn’t have to each use their own forms. This clause includes the following guarantees to the mortgagee:

• Guarantee of payment when the insured breaches a policy condition. For example, if an insured committed arson or failed to disclose a material fact that could result in denial of a claim payment to an insured, the mortgagee would still be entitled to payment.

• Guarantee that the insurer will not reduce coverage nor terminate the policy without due notice to the mortgagee. When reducing coverage, the mortgagee must consent to the change. When terminating the policy, the mortgagee is entitled to due notice.

7.5 THE COMPREHENSIVE HOMEOWNER, TENANT, CONDOMINIUM UNIT OWNER PACKAGE POLICY

We’ll now take a closer look at the different sections of the Comprehensive Homeowner, Tenant, Condominium Unit Owner Package Policy. This document provides a realistic example of the wordings — including limits, exclusions, clauses, and conditions — of real policies. It includes both property coverages and liability coverages. It’s important to note that we’ll be examining this document strictly for study purposes, because individual company policy forms take precedence over this policy. Nevertheless, it provides a good foundation for learning to become a habitational broker.

This form has been written in plain, or clear, language. This makes it easier for insureds to read and understand their policies. This also makes it easier for the broker, because they need to be concerned with only one list of exclusions applicable to all policies.

7.5.1 Definitions

The full list of definitions is included in the policy, and all are important. However, pay attention to definitions with a direct impact on who will receive claim payment and what is covered.

7.5.1.1 Insured

“Insured” means the person(s) named in the coverage summary page and, while living in the same household,

• Their spouse. A spouse is defined as:

- Either a man or a woman who are married to each other or who have together entered into a marriage that is voidable or void; or

- Either of two persons who are living together in a conjugal relationship outside marriage and have so lived together continuously for a period of three years. Or, if they are the natural or adoptive parents of a child, for a period of one year.

• The relatives of either. (This can include children, parents, or grandparents; there is no age barrier.)

• Any person under 21 in their care. (This can include foster children or exchange students. However, roomers and boarders of any age are not included in this definition.)

The insured is also known as the loss payee, who is the person named in an insurance policy who will be paid in the event of a loss.

Note: Not only are common law relationships becoming more common, but various forms of common ownership of dwelling are becoming more common too. (That’s a lot of “commons”!) Some people make assumptions about their relationships that may or may not meet the test of the policy definition.

It is important for the broker to clearly understand who occupies the dwelling and either (1) make sure people’s names are properly added or (2) set up separate policies to ensure that the test of insurable interest is met.

All persons included in the definition must live in the same household as the named insured. The definition has been extended to include “a student who is enrolled in, and actually attends a school, college, or university and who is dependent on the named insured or his or her spouse for support and maintenance even if temporarily residing away from the principal residence stated on the coverage summary page.” Whether the student is in residence or is living off campus, this policy will extend coverage to them for their possessions.

7.5.1.2 Premises

In the case of a Homeowner Policy, “premises” means the dwelling and the land contained within the lot lines on which the dwelling is situated. In the case of a Tenant or Condominium Unit Owner Policy, it means the dwelling or unit and includes garages, outbuildings, and private approaches reserved for the tenant’s use and occupancy only.

It is important to know this definition. If an insured owns or occupies property other than those covered by these definitions, that property should be added to the policy to ensure proper coverage.

7.5.1.3 Vacancy

“Vacant” means:

• Whether partially or fully furnished, the occupant(s) has/have moved out with no intent to return.

• A newly constructed dwelling is vacant after it is completed and before the occupants move in.

• The occupant has moved out and no new occupant has moved in.

Insureds make assumptions that policies will remain in force until expiry, no matter the circumstances of occupancy. As a broker, you’ll have to become familiar with these assumptions and help your clients become better informed.

For example, a home is not considered vacant if the homeowner goes to Arizona or Florida each winter for several months because there is an intent to return.

Another common occurance is for an elderly person who lives alone and is moved into a longterm care facility (e.g. nursing home) for 2 months after an event like major surgery. Since there is the intent to return, the home is not considered vacant. However, if after 2 months the person realizes they cannot move back home, then their home is considered vacant.

Many new teardown or infill constructions have a gap period between the time the contractor quits the construction and the owner moves into the new building. In both of these situations, the broker must make sure the insured is aware that coverage may not be in force when a claim occurs.

7.5.1.4 Other Definitions

Other definitions — such as “business,” “domestic water container,” “fungi,” “mold,” “ground water,” “surface water,” “residence employee,” and “watermain” — should also be studied, as they all have a direct impact on limits and coverages. They are no less important than the three terms noted above.

7.5.2 Section I: Property Coverages

The remainder of this chapter will focus on Section I: Property Coverages. Section II: Liability Coverages will be covered in Chapter 8: Liability Insurance.

This section is broken into four parts. We will take each of these parts and apply them to the appropriate residential structure, be it a homeowner, condominium unit owner, or tenant.
Coverage 	Property 	Applicability
Coverage A 	Building 	Homeowner
Coverage A1, A2, and A3 		Condominium unit owner
Coverage B 	Detached private structures 	Homeowner
Coverage C 	Personal property contents 	All
Coverage D 	Additional living expense 	All

The table above shows that the components of the Homeowner Policy are based in Coverage A, but they then flow into specific areas of the other coverages (B, C, and D).

For Condominium Unit Owner and Tenant Policies, the value on the declarations page is generated from the personal property contents (Coverage C), which are unique to every insured. When helping your clients apply for coverage, it’s important to determine limits that are adequate for their needs.

An inventory calculator will help insureds to determine the correct amount of coverage to purchase. It’s also important to check the claim payments section for the limit of insurance to determine how much a policy will pay.

7.5.2.1 Coverage A: Dwelling Building (Homeowner Applicable Only)

The amount of insurance indicated on the coverage summary page for Coverage A: Dwelling Building includes the value of:

• The dwelling and attached structures: Structures such as an attached or built-in garage, a carport, a deck, or a sunroom would be insured under this limit and should be included when determining the building value.

• Permanently installed outdoor equipment on the premises: This includes items permanently embedded in concrete or otherwise fixed to the land, such as swings, slides, and lawn sprinkler systems.

• Outdoor swimming pool and attached equipment: Both above- and in-ground pools are covered in this section. They should be noted in the Home Evaluation Calculator, which would determine their value — this takes away the guesswork of trying to determine ages of pools or landscaping costs.

• Certain construction materials and supplies: Material and supplies located on or adjacent to the premises intended for use in the construction, alteration, or repair of the dwelling or private structures on the premises. This applies for both houses under construction and for dwelling renovations.

Note: If theft is excluded from coverage while a dwelling is being constructed, then this coverage will apply only when the dwelling is completed and ready to be occupied.

Note: The building supplies must be intended for use on the insured’s premises and not some other building.

• Building fixtures and fittings temporarily removed: Storm doors, windows, and shutters temporarily removed for repair or storage are covered up to 10% of the building value. These items must be currently used; the coverage is not intended to cover items rendered obsolete by retrofitting with new, energy-efficient windows and doors. Obsolete items stored in a shed that subsequently burns down are not covered.

• Outdoor trees, shrubs, plants, and lawns: The insured can opt to apply up to 5% of the value of Coverage A: Dwelling Building to outdoor trees, shrubs, plants, and lawns. There is a maximum of $500 for any one of these perils including debris removal, and the coverage is limited to:

- Fire.

- Lightning.

- Explosion.

- Impact by aircraft or land vehicles.

- Riot and vandalism.

- Malicious acts.

There is no coverage for the perils of windstorm, hail, or theft. Coverage is for domestic plants only.

7.5.2.2 Coverage A1, A2, and A3 (Condominium Unit Owner Applicable Only)

A condominium is defined as

“a system regulated by statute to allow clear and full ownership of a specific unit with a building and a shared interest and responsibility in the Common elements (known as common property).”19

The ownership of the condominium building is in the name of the condominium corporation (also known as a strata corporation in some parts of Canada) and, once established, the condominium corporation enacts its own by-laws to govern and direct its actions. Individuals may own one or more units and will have a proportionately divided interest in the condominium’s common elements, which include:

• Parking areas.

• Walkways.

• Landscaping.

• Recreational areas.

• Pools.

• Saunas.

It is the responsibility of the condominium corporation to insure the value of the building and all its common elements under a master policy. Individual owners of the units are responsible for insuring the contents of their units.

Condominiums come in many different types of structures. For example, they could be single detached houses in a development where there is private (from the larger town/city) but common ownership of the streets and infrastructure it sits on. In this case, coverage would be provided by a Homeowner Policy that has been amended into a hybrid form with the addition of coverage for the common elements. In another example, condos could be high-rise, fire-resistive structures where units are stacked on top of one another. In this case, the policy limit is based on determining the contents of the unit, with the excess coverages automatically included in the form.

Note: The forms of condominiums will continue to evolve as developers become more creative, so brokers must be aware and not assume that we can apply one form to every situation.

To simplify things, think of our example condominium as a unit in a high-rise building. This will help us understand how Coverage A1, A2, and A3 are used to fill in gaps that may occur between the insured’s policy and the master policy of the corporation.

7.5.2.2.1 Coverage A1: The Unit

For Coverage A1, $100,000 is provided as the minimum amount on the unit itself, excluding any improvements and betterments if no insurance is carried by the corporation, or that insurance limit is inadequate or ineffective. However, this limit can be increased.

Coverage A1 also provides coverage for:

• Building fixtures and fittings.

• Frescoes.

• Plate glass, other glass.

• Permanently installed outdoor equipment located anywhere on the property administered by the corporation.

This coverage cannot be used to pay any portion of any deductible under the corporation master policy.

7.5.2.2.2 Coverage A2: Loss Assessment

If coverage under the corporation master policy is inadequate to cover losses to collectively owned property, a special assessment may be levied against each unit owner. This could occur because of under-insurance, a large deductible, the application of a co-insurance penalty, the cause of the loss not being an insured peril, or a breach of the policy conditions.

This form provides the unit owner with loss assessment coverage in the amount of $10,000, which can be increased by payment of additional premium. This form does not cover all assessments, and it will apply only when the assessment is due to a loss insured under the unit owner’s policy. If the loss is excluded under the unit owner’s policy, there is no coverage available. Coverage cannot be used to pay any portion of any deductible under the condominium master policy.

7.5.2.2.3 Coverage A3: Unit Improvements and Betterments

Any betterments or improvements made to a condo unit made by the condo owner will increase the replacement value of the unit. Such increases are not recoverable under the condominium corporation’s master building insurance policy. In the past, high-rise condominium corporations typically defined a standard unit to include the values of the original carpeting, wall covering, and the plumbing fixtures of each unit. These values were factored into the amount of insurance provided by corporation master building insurance policy. It is important to note that most new and many older condominium corporations have amended the description of a unit to the effect that some or all of the above items are all considered under betterments and improvements. (i.e. they are not part of the standard unit and will not be covered by the corporation’s master building insurance policy. The result is each unit owner is responsible for insuring those items.) Brokers really need to discuss this matter with their clients and ensure adequate coverage limits for unit improvements.

Coverage A3 provides 100% of the limit shown in Coverage A1 for the unit improvement and betterments made or acquired by the insured, including any building, structure, or swimming pool on the premises and any material and supplies on the premises for use in such improvements and betterments. As Coverage A3 follows Coverage A1, an increase in Coverage A1 will increase Coverage A3.

Many owners of older condominium units will undertake major renovations to replace outdated kitchens and bathrooms, so brokers must make the insured aware that recovery for these expenses is made through their own policy and not the master policy. It’s wise to mention this at every renewal review so that the limits can be addressed.

7.5.2.3 Coverage B: Detached Private Structures (Homeowner Applicable Only)

The policy insures structures or buildings on the premises separated from the dwelling by a clear space and not included under Coverage A: Dwelling Building. Even if they are connected by a fence, utility line, or a similar connection, they will be considered detached. The normal limit is 10% of Coverage A: Dwelling Building, and the policy does not prorate that limit if there is more than one private structure. Because this coverage is automatic, the detached structures do not have to be declared. If the detached structure is a large building and its value is more than the 10%, this should be noted on the policy.

7.5.2.4 Coverage C: Contents (Applicable to All)

Under this section, residential contents are covered at three different locations: on-premises coverage, off-premises coverage, and student coverage.

7.5.2.4.1 On-Premises Coverage

This insuring agreement includes “all personal property you own, wear or use while on your premises, which is usual to the ownership or maintenance of a dwelling.” This definition of personal property is extremely broad. It includes all dwelling contents, clothing, and other personal items, and any other property owned or used on the premises.

If the insured wishes, this coverage can be extended to include “uninsured personal property of others” while it is in a portion of the dwelling occupied by the insureds. Payment will be made whether the insured is responsible for the loss. However, property of roomers and boarders who are not related to the insured are an exception — their property is not covered under this form, and they need to purchase the required coverages under their own policy.

7.5.2.4.2 Off-Premises Coverage

Personal property is covered while it is temporarily away from the premises, anywhere in the world. If the insured wishes, they can include uninsured personal property belonging to others while in the insured’s possession or belonging to a residence employee travelling with the insured.

Property in storage, in a controlled access location, is covered on an all-risks basis for only 30 days. If requested in writing, coverage may be extended beyond that date, but only for the peril of theft.

7.5.2.4.3 Student Coverage

This covers the personal property of any student insured by this policy, who is temporarily living away from home for the purpose of attending a school, college, or university. This coverage would cease when the student graduates or ceases to be a tuition-paying student. They would be required to purchase their own policy at that time. This coverage has a special limit with respect to theft.

7.5.2.4.4 Applicable to Tenants

In addition to the three types of contents coverages above, there is one more component: applicable to tenants. This is coverage provided for improvements or betterments that insureds make or acquire to the dwelling that they rent. They are included under personal property.

7.5.2.4.5 Contents Excluded From Coverage

As broad as the wording is for contents covered, there are certain contents that are not covered. We touched on this in general terms in Section 7.4.5: Exclusions, but we will now be more specific. The following items are not insured:

• Motorized vehicles or their equipment (except for watercraft, lawn mowers, other gardening equipment, snow blowers, remote-controlled caddies, wheelchairs, or scooters having more than two wheels and that are specifically designed for the carriage of a person who has a physical disability).

• Camper units, truck caps, trailers, or their equipment.

• Aircraft or their equipment, including audio, visual, recording, or transmitting equipment powered by the electrical system of a motor vehicle or aircraft. Equipment does not include spare automobile parts.

• Personal property normally kept at any other location owned, rented, or occupied by the insured.

• Outdoor trees, shrubs, plants, lawns, or other items grown for commercial purposes.

7.5.2.4.6 Special Limits of Insurance

Of all the contents that are covered, there are special limits applicable to certain personal property items. The personal property owned by different insureds can vary significantly. For example, while some will own expensive items, such as jewellery or watercraft, others will not. For this reason, it would be unfair to charge everyone the same premium for their policies.

At the same time, insurers do not want to create gaps in their insureds’ coverage by not providing any protection at all for those items. The most practical solution is to provide every insured with the minimum amounts of coverage for such items. People having higher values of such property should purchase increased coverage. (We’ll see how this coverage is provided in our discussion on endorsements.)

These special limits can be divided into two categories:

1) Those that apply to specified property items, regardless of the cause of the insured loss.

2) Those where there is no limit if the loss is caused by a specified peril.

The Homeowner Policy wording provides a full list of special limits and specified perils.

7.5.2.4.6.1 Special Limits A

• Business property: Up to $2,000 in all. This is the total amount available for all books, tools, and instruments pertaining to a business, profession, or occupation. Coverage is provided for such property only while it is physically on the insured’s premises. Other property used for business purposes including samples and goods held for sale are not insured.

• Securities: Stocks, bonds, and other securities are insured up to $2,000 in all. Insureds having such documents on their premises should be encouraged to store them in a safety deposit box at a financial institution.

• Personal property used by any student insured by the policy and who is temporarily living away from home: Up to $2,500 in all. This limit will likely be inadequate when items such as household furnishings, personal computers, and sporting equipment are insured

• Money including cash, cards, or bullion: Up to $200 in all. People normally do not keep large amounts of money, gold, or silver on their premises. Limiting the amount of insurance coverage for money and bullion to $200 encourages people to use financial institutions for safekeeping.

• Garden type tractors, including attachments and accessories: Up to $5,000 in all.

• Watercraft: Up to $1,000 in all. The limit of $1,000 represents the total amount available for watercraft, their furnishings, equipment, accessories, and motors.

• Computer software: Up to $2,500 in all. It is important that insureds understand this limitation applies only to computer software and not to computer hardware. Because homes now often have more than one computer, the demand for sophisticated software will continue to grow. The costs of computer games, “smart home” audio/device management, and personal financial programs can easily amount to thousands of dollars.

• Spare automobile parts: Up to $1,000 in all. Coverage is provided for automobile parts such as fan belts, hub caps, wheels, spark plugs, and starters.

7.5.2.4.6.2 Special Limits B

The limits below apply to specified property items that have been stolen. Types of property affected by this limitation include:

• Up to $1,000 in all:

- Numismatic property (such as coin collections).

• Up to $500 in all:

- Each bicycle, its equipment, and accessories.

• Up to $1,000 in all:

- Manuscripts.

- Stamps.

- Philatelic property (such as stamp collections).

- Collectible cards (such as sports personality cards).

• Up to $2,000 in all:

- Jewellery.

- Watches.

- Gems.

- Fur garments and garments trimmed with fur.

These limits apply to the total values of each of the above classes of property owned by the insured. For example, payment for theft of the insured’s jewellery, watches, gems, and furs would be limited in total to $2,000; the insured would not receive that amount for each item. Additional insurance can be purchased, if needed.

While the special limits above apply to losses caused by theft, insureds can also purchase coverage for unlimited losses caused by specified perils. For example, jewellery valued at $25,000 would be insured for its full value when the loss is caused by any of the following specified perils:

• Fire.

• Lightning.

• Explosion.

• Smoke due to a sudden, unusual, and faulty operation of any heating or cooking unit in or on the premises.

• Falling object that strikes the exterior of a building.

• Impact by aircraft or land vehicle.

• Riot.

• Vandalism or malicious act, not including loss or damage caused by theft or attempted theft.

• Water damage caused by:

- The sudden and accidental escape of water from a watermain.

- The sudden and accidental escape of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, sprinkler, or air conditioning system or domestic water container which is located inside the dwelling.

- The sudden and accidental escape of water from a domestic water container located outside the dwelling (but such damage is not covered when the escape of water is caused by freezing).

- Water that enters the dwelling through an opening which has been created suddenly and accidentally by an insured peril.

• Windstorm or hail.

• Transportation, meaning loss or damage caused by collision, upset, overturn, derailment, stranding, or sinking of any automobile or attached trailer in which the insured property is being carried. This also applies to any conveyance of a common carrier, but does not include loss or damage to property in a vacation or home trailer owned by the insured.

7.5.2.4.6.3 Deductibles on Special Limit Claims

For claims involving personal property in which a special limit of insurance applies, the limitation applies only to losses exceeding the deductible amount. For example:
Loss of garden tractor caused by fire: 	$8,000
Deductible selected by insured: 	$500
Amount of loss after deductible applied: 	$7,500
Maximum payable (special limit of insurance): 	$5,000

Note: Insurers using the IBC Homeowner Policy forms will often make changes to them. As a result, different insurers may have different special limits of insurance. It is the broker’s job to know the limits provided by the policies they sell. Failure to advise insureds of these limits could result in potential errors and omissions claims against the broker and the brokerage.

7.5.2.5 Coverage D: Additional Living Expense (Applicable to All)

This insuring agreement provides two coverages: additional living expense and fair rental value. Let’s look at these briefly.

7.5.2.5.1 Additional Living Expense

Additional living expense coverage applies when:

• The dwelling is damaged by an insured peril; and

• The damage is sufficient to make the dwelling unfit for occupancy or requires that the insured(s) move out while repairs are being made.

Generally, people will incur additional living expense when forced to live away from their homes. For example, if you had to leave your home due to some damage and the repair work took weeks, it would likely cost more to live and eat at a hotel than it would at home.

Other costs that might be incurred after a loss that were not present before that loss include:

• Cost to place family pet in a kennel.

• Taxi fare to take children to and from school.

• Costs of moving personal effects to a new temporary location.

The insurer is obligated to pay additional living expenses only. In other words, payment is limited to costs “over and above” what it would normally have cost the insureds to live if the loss had not occurred.

• Payment for additional living expense is made only for:

• The reasonable time that is required to repair or rebuild the dwelling; or

• If the insured decides to permanently relocate, the reasonable time required to settle elsewhere.

Let’s look at an example of an additional living expense claim.

Last fall, the Chanthara family was forced to find temporary accommodations when a fire caused extensive damage to their home. They stayed at the local motel for one month before being able to return home. During that time, they incurred the following expenses:
Item 	Fee
Restaurant expenses 	$1,800
Accommodations 	$2,200
Kennel 	$240
Taxi fare 	$400
Moving 	$100

Remember: the insurer is obligated to pay additional living expenses only, meaning costs “over and above” what it would normally have cost the Chantharas to live if the loss had not occurred.

Let’s assume that food normally costs the Chantharas $600 per month. As the following calculation shows, that amount will be deducted from the total amount incurred for food while living away from home.
Cost of food (after loss): 	$1,800
Cost of food (prior to loss): 	$600
Amount payable 	$1,200

In this example, all kennel costs, taxi fares, and moving expenses would be paid in full. These expenses never existed before the loss, so their full amounts qualify as additional living expenses. The amount payable for accommodations will normally be paid in full.

Payment is limited to expenses that were necessarily incurred for the insureds to maintain their normal standard of living. This means the Chantharas cannot use a loss to their dwelling as an opportunity to improve their standard of living. For example, if they owned an 800 square foot bungalow, the insurer wouldn’t be required to pay all additional accommodation costs if they rented a 1,600 square foot bungalow.

7.5.2.5.2 Fair Rental Value

People who rent out a portion of their dwelling or detached private structure (for example, a garage) will lose rental income when loss from an insured peril makes the structure unfit for occupancy. The loss of fair rental value is insured under the Homeowner Policy forms for the reasonable time that is required to repair or rebuild the dwelling or detached private structure.

In the following situations, the insurer pays additional living expense and fair rental value for a period not exceeding two weeks:

• When access to the insured’s property is prohibited by order of civil authority.

For example, a riot in the area may result in the insured being denied access to the dwelling. The order restricting such access would generally be made by a civil authority, such as the chief of police or other local government officials. In these cases, the insured may incur additional living expenses. Also, the insured may lose the rent for the number of days their tenants, if any, are unable to access the dwelling. The Homeowner Policy forms provide payment of these amounts.

• When the peril that caused the order to be given is insured under the insured’s own policy.

For example, when the order to evacuate the area is the result of an earthquake, there is no coverage for additional living expense or fair rental value (unless earthquakes are covered under the insured’s policy).

7.5.2.6 Applying Coverages to the Policy Forms

Let’s compare the coverages based on the building types in the chart below.
	Homeowner 	Condominium Unit Owner 	Tenant
Coverage A (Building) 	Yes 	A1, A2, A3 	No
Coverage B (Outbuilding) 	Yes 	No 	No
Coverage C (Contents) 	Yes 	Yes 	Yes
Coverage D (Extra Expense) 	Yes 	Yes 	Yes

7.5.2.7 Extensions of Coverage

The following additional coverages are provided to all insureds under the Homeowner Policy forms:

• Debris removal: This coverage is available when loss or damage is caused by an insured peril. If the amount payable for loss (including expense for debris removal) is greater than the amount of insurance, an additional 5% of that amount will be available to cover debris removal.

• Property removed: Coverage is provided for property that has been removed to protect it from loss or damage. This property is insured for 30 days or until the expiry of the policy, whichever occurs first.

• Moving to another home: Coverage is automatically extended to insure property while in transit to and at another location that is to be occupied by the insureds as their principal residence. Coverage is restricted to Canada and is provided for 30 consecutive days only, or until the policy expires or is terminated, whichever is sooner.

• Damage to dwelling (applicable to tenant): A tenant may apply up to $500 of the amount of Coverage C: Contents to pay for damage caused to the portion of the dwelling they occupy (if the damage was caused by theft or attempted theft) or to the interior portion (if the damage was caused by vandalism or malicious acts). Coverage is also provided for the impact of a vehicle operated by the insured.

• Fire department expenses: Up to $1,000 for fire department charges is provided. The deductible is not applied to this coverage.

• Change of temperature: Coverage is provided for loss or damage to personal property due to a change of temperature resulting from physical damage to the dwelling or equipment from an insured peril.

For example, if building glass was broken by vandals and the broken glass caused house plants to freeze, this damage could be covered under change of temperature.

Note that the loss to the insured’s house plants was not caused directly by vandalism, but arose because of it. Property policies do not insure indirect losses, so there would be no coverage for the above losses without this extension.

Furthermore, even with this extension in place, the insured must show that there was actual physical damage to the building or its equipment from an insured peril before payment is made. For example, the policy will not pay for loss to food in a freezer caused by the power cord being accidentally or deliberately disconnected. Similarly, freezing of household plants due to a malfunctioning furnace is not insured.

Finally, the property being claimed must have been in the dwelling at the time of its loss.

• Freezer food: The Homeowner Policy forms provide up to $2,000 for food contained in a freezer located on the insured’s premises when the loss or damage is due to power failure. In power failure situations, coverage is provided when there is an accidental interruption of electrical power on or off the insured’s premises. For example, there is no coverage when the power supply is interrupted due to the failure of the insured to pay for electrical services or because of a planned outage by the electrical utility company. Coverage is specifically excluded for spoilage of food due to the following:

- The operation of circuit breakers or fuses.

- The accidental or intentional disconnection of the power supply in the building containing the freezer.

- The disruption of power when the freezer’s electrical cord is disconnected by a family pet or is accidentally or deliberately disconnected during vacuuming.

Losses originating from these causes are not insured:

• Mechanical breakdown: Coverage is provided for damage to a food freezer when it is due to food spoilage covered by this extension. Also, the insurer agrees to pay reasonable expenses incurred by the insureds to save and preserve food while their freezer is being repaired. This coverage is not subject to a deductible.

• Lock replacement: Up to $500 is provided to replace or re-key the locks on the insured’s principal dwelling. This coverage is available only when the insured’s keys have been stolen and the loss has been reported to authorities. The decision either to replace lost keys or to rekey existing locks is made by the insurer. This coverage is not subject to a deductible.

• Tear out: This is coverage for the repairs of walls, ceilings, or other parts of insured buildings that must be torn apart before water damage from pipes or a domestic water container can be repaired. The cost of tearing out and replacing any part of the building to repair damage caused by swimming pools or public watermains is not insured.

• Arson and burglary conviction reward: The insurer agrees to pay up to $1,000 in all for information which leads to a conviction for arson or burglary in connection with a loss to property insured. This amount is in addition to other limits provided by the policy and is not subject to a deductible.

• Credit or debit cards, forgery, and counterfeit money: Theft of credit and debit cards can result in financial loss to insureds. Theft, and other losses directly attributable to forgery and receipt of counterfeit money, are insured by the policy. Coverage is limited to $2,000 in total during the policy period. This coverage is not subject to a deductible.

• Inflation protection: When there is a loss during the policy period, the insurer will automatically increase the amount of insurance provided under Section I: Property Coverages of the Homeowner Policy forms by amounts which are solely attributable to inflation.

7.5.2.8 All-Risks Coverage

The greatest advantage to insureds purchasing this form is that all property owned by the insured is covered on an all-risks basis. As stated in an All-Risks policy, “insures against all risks of direct physical loss or damage subject to policy conditions and exclusions”. In simple terms, all losses to property are insured unless they are specifically excluded.

For example, the Comprehensive Policy Form insures loss or damage to both the dwelling and personal property caused by smoke from a fireplace. It also insures loss or damage caused by snow load resulting in a roof collapse. Insureds who have a fireplace in their dwelling, or who live in areas with significant sudden snow accumulation, should always consider this form. These two examples would not be covered under a Fire and Extended Coverage policy.

7.5.2.8.1 All-Risks Exclusions

Listing the perils insured by this policy would be an impossible task. Instead of stating what is covered, policies providing all-risks coverage specifically identify which perils are excluded by the policy. It is important to have a good understanding of these exclusions and be aware of the impact they could have on an insured’s property and possessions. Some exclusions (such as sewer backup and earthquake) can be removed by endorsement, but most of the others cannot be removed.

For example, there is no coverage for loss or damage to:

• Building or structures used in whole or in part for business or farming purposes.

• Property at any fairground, exhibition, or exposition for the purposes of exhibition.

• Any property illegally acquired, kept stored, or transported, or property subject to forfeiture.

• Evidence of title or debt.

• Sporting equipment where the loss or damage is due to its use.

• Animals, birds, or fish, unless the loss or damage is caused by a specified peril other than impact by aircraft or land vehicle.

• Any property lawfully seized or confiscated, unless such property is destroyed to prevent the spread of fire.

• Scratching, abrasion, or chipping of personal property or breakage of fragile or brittle articles, unless caused by a specified peril, accident to a land vehicle or aircraft, or theft or attempted theft.

• Outdoor radio and TV antennae (including satellite receivers) and their attachments caused by windstorm or hail, weight of ice, snow or sleet, or collapse.

• Wear and tear, deterioration, defect, or mechanical breakdown.

• The cost of making good faulty material or workmanship.

• Settling, expansion, contraction, moving, bulging, buckling, or cracking, except resulting damage to building glass.

Loss or damage is also not insured under the following situations:

• If the loss or damage occurs after the dwelling has, to the insured’s knowledge, been vacant for more than 30 consecutive days.

• If the loss or damage is caused directly or indirectly by any nuclear incident as defined in the Nuclear Liability Act or any other nuclear liability act, law, or statute, or any law amendatory thereof or nuclear explosion, except for the ensuing loss or damage that results directly from fire, or explosion of natural, coal, or manufactured gas.

• If the loss or damage is caused by contamination of radioactive material.

• If the loss or damage is caused by war, invasions, or civil war, insurrection, rebellion, revolution, military power, hostilities, or an act of a foreign enemy.

• If the loss or damage result from any intentional or criminal act or failure to act by:

- Any person insured by this policy, or

- Any other person at the direction of any person insured by this policy.

• If the loss or damage is to personal property undergoing any process or while being worked on, where the damage results from such process or work. (However, resulting damage to other property is insured.)

• If the loss or damage is caused by water, unless the loss or damage resulted from:

- The sudden and accidental escape of water from a watermain.

- The sudden and accidental escape of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, sprinkler or air conditioning system or domestic appliance, which is located inside an insured building.

- The sudden and accidental escape of water from a domestic water container located outside the dwelling. (However, such damage is not insured when the escape of water is caused by freezing.)

- Water that entered through an opening which was created suddenly and accidentally by a specified peril other than water damage.

• If the loss or damage is caused by water, including:

- Caused by freezing during the normal heating season, if this occurred within a heated portion of the dwelling and the insured has been away from the premises for more than four consecutive days, or if the insured placed the items within an unheated portion of the dwelling. However, the loss or damage will still be insured if they have taken the following precautions:

• Arranged for a competent person to enter the dwelling each day while the insured was away to ensure that heating was being maintained, or

• Shut off the water supply and had drained all the pipes and domestic water containers.

- Caused by continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water.

- Caused by the backing up or escape of water from a sewer, sump, or septic tank.

- Caused by ground water or the rising of the water table.

- Caused by surface waters, unless the water escapes from a watermain or from a domestic water container located outside the dwelling.

- Caused by shoreline ice buildup or by water-borne ice or other objects, all whether driven by wind or not.

- Caused to a watermain.

- Caused to a domestic water container from which the water escaped.

- Caused while the building is under construction or vacant, even if the insurer has given permission for construction or vacancy.

• If the loss or damage is caused by birds, vermin, rodents, insects, or raccoons, except loss or damage to building glass.

• If the loss or damage is caused by smoke from agricultural smudging or industrial operations.

• If the loss or damage is caused by snowslide, earthquake, landslide, or any other earth movement, except for ensuring loss or damage which results from fire or explosion.

• If the loss or damage is caused by theft or attempted theft:

- Which happens at any other location that the insured owns, rents, or occupies, except while the insured is temporarily living there or if a student’s residence.

- From the part of the dwelling rented to others caused by theft or attempted theft by a tenant, tenant’s employee, or member of a tenant’s household.

- Of property in or from a dwelling under construction or of materials and supplies for use in the construction until the dwelling is completed and ready to be occupied.

• If the loss or damage is caused by vandalism or malicious acts or glass breakage occurring while the building is under construction or vacant, even if permission for construction or vacancy has been given by the insurer.

• If the loss or damage is caused directly or indirectly, proximately or remotely, arising in consequence of or contributed to by the enforcement of any by-law, regulation, ordinance, or law regulating zoning or the demolition, repair, or construction of building or structures, which by-law, regulation, ordinance, or law make it impossible to repair or reinstate the property as it was immediately prior to the loss, irrespective of any RC provisions elsewhere in this policy.

• If the loss or damage is caused by rust or corrosion, wet or dry rot, or by fungi or spores.

• If the loss or damage results from the release, discharge, or dispersal of fuel oil.

• If the loss or damage results from a change in ownership of property that is agreed to, even if that change was brought about by trickery or fraud.

• If the loss or damage is caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by terrorism or by any activity or decision of a government agency or other entity to prevent, respond to, or terminate terrorism. Such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss or damage.

• If the loss or damage is related to:

- Data, meaning representations of information and concepts in any form.

- Loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by a data problem, meaning erasure, destruction, corruption, error in creating the data, etc. and inability to receive, transmit or use data. However, if the loss or damage caused by the data problem results in the occurrence of further loss of or damage to property insured that is directly caused by fire, explosion, smoke, water damage, all as described in “Specified Perils,” this exclusion will not apply to such resulting loss or damage.

• If the loss or damage is related to or arising from any actual or alleged liability for any legal remedy of any kind whatsoever in respect to actual or threatened loss, damage, cost, or expense directly or indirectly caused by, resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving asbestos or any materials containing asbestos in whatever form or quantity. This exclusion applies whether or not there are one or more causes (whether covered or not) that contribute concurrently or in any sequence to the occasioning of the loss, damage, cost, or expense.

7.6 THE INSURANCE PROCESS

We have now learned all of the component parts of the Comprehensive Policy Form and how it has been developed to meet different clients’ needs. In particular, we’ve learned about all-risks coverage, as well as the various limits and exclusions under the Comprehensive Policy Form. It’s important to discuss these with the insured to determine whether there is a need to add or increase any of the limits or coverages. For some clients, the Comprehensive Policy meets all of the requirements for their residential situation (homeowner, condominium unit owner, or tenant) without any additions or deletions. Other clients will need more tailored coverage, and brokers must make those clients aware when coverages are not available or cannot be sourced from the companies they represent. This is one of the biggest challenges for brokers: finding the gaps between what the Comprehensive Policy provides and what th insured requires.

7.6.1 Single-Limit Policies

Many insurers are issuing the Homeowner Policy form on a single-limit basis. Under this approach, the limits of insurance under Coverages A through D in Section I: Property Coverages are combined into one inclusive limit of insurance.

For example, if Coverage A: Dwelling Building had a limit of $220,000, it would be doubled under the single-limit basis to a single limit of $440,000.

Single-limit policies can be advantageous to insureds. For example, when policies are issued with separate limits for Coverages A. B, C, and D, there is a chance that insurance limits may be inadequate for one or more of those coverages. Under single-limit policies, the only time the insured would not receive a complete indemnity is when the total amount of insurance purchased was inadequate to cover the loss.

7.6.2 Insurance Under More Than One Policy

In some cases, the insured may have another insurance policy that applies to a loss or claim and would have applied if this policy did not exist. In these situations, this policy will be considered excess insurance, and the insurer would not pay any loss or claim until the amount of the other insurance is used up.

7.7 OTHER POLICY FORMS: SECONDARY AND SEASONAL RESIDENCES

Insurance companies prefer risks that meet the standard of being owner-occupied year-round, with both fire hydrant and fire hall protection. When the location doesn’t meet these standards, as in the case of secondary and seasonal residences, the risk for the insurer increases.

For example, a secondary dwelling may have the advantage of being within range of a fire hydrant, but the non-owner occupancy both reduces the coverages available and increases the premium. Or a seasonal dwelling may be owner occupied, but its increased distance away from fire protection and its non-occupancy for part of the year both reduces the coverages available and increases the premium. There are many exceptions, but these are the general rules as we look at the following two policy forms.

7.7.1 Secondary Residence Form: Fire and Extended Coverage

This form is designed for individuals who own an additional dwelling that is usually rented in part or totally to others, and that would not qualify for the coverages available to single-family, owner-occupied dwellings. Insurers normally reserve their best coverage forms for owner-occupied dwellings. As such, dwellings that are owned by the insured but occupied by others are normally subject to restricted coverage.

When clients place insurance for their secondary residence, this additional location is added to the primary policy as Location 2. For our purposes, it is not treated as a standalone policy. There is only one section of coverage under this form, covering the dwelling building and contents. Liability coverage is extended from Section II: Liability Coverages of the insured’s primary package policy to cover this location, and it must be indicated on the declarations page for coverage to be in effect.

Note: The definitions contained in this form for “insured,” “business,” “detached private structures,” etc. are the same as those described earlier in the chapter. Likewise, the previous discussion on dwellings and contents is applicable here, except where noted.

For our purposes, picture the secondary residence as a single-family dwelling with a detached garage and a storage shed in the backyard. It is fire hydrant protected and within the same locale as the primary dwelling. It is occupied by tenants with a proper lease.

7.7.1.1 Coverage A: Dwelling Building

The amount of insurance indicated on the declarations page for Coverage A: Dwelling Building include the values of:

• The dwelling and attached structures.

• Outdoor swimming pool and attached equipment on the premises.

• Permanently installed outdoor equipment on the premises.

• Material and supplies located on or adjacent to the premises intended for use in the construction, alteration, or repair of the dwelling or private structures on the premises.

7.7.1.1.1 Extensions of Coverage

The following extensions of coverage are available to the insured — however, they do not increase the limit available under Coverage A: Dwelling Building.

The insured may apply up to 10% of the amount of insurance on the dwelling to insure each of the following:

• Building fixtures and fittings temporarily removed from the premises for repair or seasonal storage.

• Detached private structures on the premises. If there is more than one detached private structure, the amount of insurance will be divided in the proportions that the value of each detached structure has to the value of all such structures at the time of loss.

Let’s look at an example.

Image

Gaetan owns one primary building and two outbuildings (above picture). If the primary building is worth $100,000, this would make $10,000 available for outbuildings. The two outbuildings consist of a garage worth $8,000 and a shed worth $4,000. Their combined value is over the $10,000 limit. If the garage were to burn down, Gaetan would not receive the full $8,000; instead, the payment would be based on what the value of the garage was to the total value of the outbuildings. The combined value is $12,000, and the garage, at $8,000, is 66.66% of that total. This means Gaetan would receive 66.66% of the limit available of $10,000 ($6,666) as settlement for the lost garage, less the deductible. If the shed were to burn down, the same process would be followed: the shed at $4,000 is 33.33% of $12,000, so the payment for this loss would be 33.33% of $10,000 ($3,333).

• Fair rental value, as discussed under Coverage D: Additional Living Expense in the Homeowner Policy.

7.7.1.2 Coverage C: Personal Property

This section is designed to insure the owner’s personal property at the secondary residence. It does not provide any coverage to the tenant. Coverage is provided for:

• Personal property the insured owns, wears, or uses while on their premises which are usual to the ownership or maintenance of the dwelling.

• Motorized wheelchairs and scooters having more than two wheels and that are specifically designed for the carriage of a person who has a physical disability, remote controlled caddies, watercraft, motorized lawn mowers, other gardening equipment, and snow blowers while on the insured’s premises.

The following personal property is not insured:

• Motorized vehicles, trailers, camper units, truck caps, and aircraft or their equipment (except for motorized vehicles described above).

The following extensions of coverage are available, up to 10% of the amount of Coverage C: Personal Property. They do not increase the limit of insurance under Coverage C: Personal Property.

• Uninsured personal property of others.

• Personal property temporarily removed, limited to Canada or the continental United States.

• Additional living expenses.

Special limits of insurance include:

• Books, tools, and instruments pertaining to a business while on the premises: up to $2,000.

• Garden tractors, including their attachments and accessories: up to $5,000.

• Watercraft, their furnishings, equipment, accessories, and motors: up to $1,000.

7.7.1.2.1 Extensions of Coverage

• Debris removal: This is the cost of removal of debris from the property as result of damage or loss caused by an insured peril. This extension does not increase the amount of insurance.

• Property removed: If one must remove insured property from the premises to protect it from further loss, it is insured for 30 days or until the policy ends, whichever comes first. This extension does not increase the amount of insurance.

• Fire department charges: Includes up to $1,000 (with no deductible) for fire department charges arising from attending to the insured’s property to save property from loss. This extension does not increase the amount of insurance.

• Inflation protection (if specified in the declaration): This mirrors the coverage under the primary policy, but is only applicable to Coverage A: Dwelling Building.

7.7.1.3 Insured Perils: Fire and Extended Coverage

Under the primary policy, coverage was provided on a comprehensive or all-risks basis. In those situations, to determine if coverage is provided for a loss, we look at the exclusion list first. If the loss is not excluded, then it is covered, subject to the special limits and deductible.

A fire and extended coverage policy works in the opposite way. In these situations, we look at the perils listed as covered. If the coverage is not on the list, then the loss is not covered by the policy. Perils that are insured include:

• Fire or lightning.

• Explosion.

• Smoke.

• Falling object.

• Impact by aircraft or land vehicle.

• Riot.

• Burglary and robbery (if specified), subject to special limits.

• Vandalism or malicious acts.

• Water damage.

• Windstorm and hail.

• Electricity.

The following are exclusions to the list above (see policy wordings for complete descriptions):

• Loss or damage to buildings or structures used in whole or in part for business or farming.

• Loss after the building has been vacant for more than 30 consecutive days.

• Loss or damage caused by nuclear incident or contamination by radioactive material.

• Loss or damage caused by war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion, or terrorist acts.

• Loss or damage caused by the enforcement of any by-law.

• Loss to property undergoing a process involving the application of heat.

• Loss to illegally acquired property.

• Loss to properly seized or confiscated property.

• Loss by intentional or criminal acts by the insured or anyone under their direction.

• Damage by contamination or release of pollutants.

• Loss or damage caused by snowslide, earthquake, landslide, or earth movement, except for resulting fire.

• Loss resulting from fraudulent change in property.

• Loss or damage caused by rust or corrosion, fungi, or spores.

• Loss or damage caused by terrorism.

• Loss or damage to data caused by a data problem.

• Cannabis.

• Asbestos.

7.7.1.4 Basis of Claim Payment

For the building and private structures, the insured can choose between the two basis of claim options below, subject to the applicable amount of insurance shown in the declarations and their financial interest in the policy:

1) The ACV of the damage at the date of the occurrence.

2) The RC, subject to the same conditions as the Comprehensive Policy Form. Failure to comply means that the claim will be settled on an ACV basis.

For personal property, only the ACV is provided as the basis of settlement.

The payment of fair rental value is an inclusive percentage of Coverage A: Dwelling Building, whereas the additional living expense is a percentage of Coverage C: Personal Property. (Under the Comprehensive Policy, these two coverages were part of Coverage D: Additional Living Expense.)

The Home Evaluation Calculator is used to determine the replacement value of the house (Coverage A: Dwelling Building). The contents limit (Coverage C: Personal Property) does not follow from Coverage A: Dwelling Building — it has to be determined by the insured.

7.7.2 Seasonal Residence Form: Fire and Extended Coverage

This form is designed to provide coverage on a seasonal residence owned by the insured. Again, the definition of insured property, the perils covered, the extensions, and the exclusions are similar to that under the secondary residence coverage.

Seasonal residences can range from condominiums on ski hills to Muskoka mansions to a simple bungalow on the edge of a lake. Let’s use a simple bungalow with a boathouse outbuilding (below picture) as our example.

As mentioned above, the extensions of coverage for the secondary residence apply to the seasonal residence as well. With multiple outbuildings, the proportionality of value determines the payment of a loss to any of the structures.

However, there are two differences to note between the two policy forms:

• Vandalism was included as an insured peril in the Secondary Residence Form. For the Seasonal Residence Form, it must be purchased — otherwise, there is no coverage A provided. (Burglary must be purchased on both forms.) Additionally, there are some exclusions for seasonal vandalism (for example, if caused by theft or attempted theft).

• The basis of claim payment does not give the insured the option of receiving the RC on building and private structures. Claims for this policy are settled on an ACV basis.

In summary, we can see that the coverages available (including extensions) have been greatly reduced or are non-existent when comparing secondary and seasonal residences to the Comprehensive Policy Form. The nature and quality of the risk will determine if an insurance company will provide broader coverage to either of these types of risks. The examples we’ve outlined in this section show how different policies are applied to different risks.

7.8 ENDORSEMENTS

For some insureds, the coverages and limits of insurance offered under the standard habitational forms are not adequate. Insurers have responded by offering endorsements that address these coverage limitations.

An endorsement is an extra sheet(s) of paper attached to the policy indicating that the insurer and the insured have agreed to a change in the terms of the insurance contract. An endorsement can do several things: provide coverage for excluded property or perils, increase limits for property that is subject to the special limits, broaden coverages, decrease deductibles, or remove coverages.

Though IBC has developed a number of endorsement forms to be used with habitational policies, these forms are often modified by individual insurance companies to suit their own underwriting priorities. It is important to be aware of the variance in forms.

We will discuss some of these endorsement forms and give a general overview of their intent. These coverages and endorsements are all subject to the Statutory Conditions, and other conditions, of the policy.

7.8.1 Personal Articles Coverage

This provides coverage for certain types of high-valued personal property for an amount listed in the declarations, on an all-risk basis except as excluded, while located anywhere in the world.

Examples of property covered include, but are not limited to:

• Cameras and accessories.

• Firearms.

• Furs.

• Jewellery, precious stones, and watches.

• Stamp and coin collections.

• Musical instruments.

Note: For musical instruments, there is no coverage when the instrument is played for a fee, unless permission is given in writing by the insurer.

• Newly acquired articles, similar to those already listed on the policy, are automatically insured up to 30 days to a maximum of $5,000.

For personal articles, the basis of payment is ACV unless the insured has purchased coverage based on the agreed value of the object insured. Under a valued policy, both the insured and insurer agree on the value of the property at the time the document is issued. In the event of total loss, the agreed value is paid. There is no deductible applied for any insured loss to any item scheduled.

7.8.2 Watercraft, Outboard Motor, Trailer, and Miscellaneous Equipment Coverage

The coverage provided under most habitational forms is limited to $1,000 or less for these items. While this coverage may be adequate for canoes and rowboats, it will seldom be enough to provide adequate coverage for most recreational watercraft. When you’re helping a client place coverage for a seasonal dwelling, always ask whether they have any watercraft for use at this location.

Coverage is provided only for the items described on the coverage summary page, including:

• The boat, including permanently attached equipment.

• The motor(s).

• The boat trailer.

• Boat equipment not included in the items above.

Most policies allow for coverage on an all-risks basis, except as excluded. Transportation losses and collision with underwater rocks and other objects, including objects floating on the water, are examples of such exclusions.

Coverage is normally restricted to Canada and the continental United States. Insureds must insure to 100% of the value of the property, and a $100 deductible applies.

Automatic coverage is provided for up to 30 days for newly acquired watercraft, outboard motors, trailers, and miscellaneous equipment, up to $5,000.

7.8.3 Food Freezer Coverage

This coverage is applicable to secondary and seasonal dwellings. Many people with seasonal dwellings spend extended periods of time at these locations. They may keep a freezer in these locations for the convenience of storing frozen foods. This coverage is designed to provide the same coverage for freezer foods in secondary and seasonal dwellings as provided under the insured’s principal residence.

7.8.4 Fine Arts Coverage

This coverage provides insurance on an all-risks basis for objects regarded as fine arts for the amounts as listed on the declarations page. Examples of fine art objects are paintings, pictures, etchings, tapestries, rare books, antique furniture, and porcelains.

Location restrictions apply. The property is covered at the locations specified in the declarations, while in transit between those locations, or in any other location in Canada or the continental United States. The exception is when the property is located at fairgrounds or expositions. In these situations, the limit is reduced to 10% of the amount shown on the declarations.

There are several exclusions to note. Newly acquired items are covered for up to 30 days but limited to 25% of the sum insured. For an additional premium, breakage can be deleted as an exclusion from the coverage.

7.8.5 Earthquake Coverage

Damage caused by an earthquake is excluded under all habitational forms; however, insureds can purchase earthquake coverage.

Coverage is provided on an occurrence basis, because earthquakes are unique (that is, each shock may be accompanied by one or more aftershocks). The insurer agrees that when more than one earthquake shock occurs within any 168 hours, it is deemed to be a single occurrence.

The coverage is all-risks, and there are three exclusions. The deductible is a percentage of the total amount of insurance on Coverages A, B, C, and D. The country is divided into zones based on the potential for earthquakes to occur, determined by the underlying geology (the coast of British Columbia and the Ottawa Valley are two of the higher-rated zones).

Earthquake coverage can be applied to a condominium on an all-risks basis, which would provide coverage for personal property, additional living expense, unit improvement and benefits, loss assessment, and additional unit protection. The deductible is stated as a percentage of the coverages.

7.8.6 Personal Computer Coverage

This coverage is provided on an all-risks basis, except as excluded for personal computer equipment, media, and software listed on the declarations page, and subject to the deductible, anywhere in the world.

Additionally, there are two special conditions that brokers should be aware of:

1) Newly acquired articles are insured for 30 days, subject to the following limitations:

• Equipment: $5,000.

• Media or software: $1,000.

2) If the loss occurs by theft from an unattended vehicle, the property is covered only if there was forcible entry into a locked vehicle.

7.8.7 Residence Glass Breakage Deductible

For an additional premium, the insured can have the deductible on building glass reduced or, in some cases, eliminated altogether.

7.8.8 Flood

While wind and fire are explicitly covered under the Comprehensive Policy forms for habitation policies, the word “flood” is usually a cause of confusion in insurance. While flood (such as waves, tidal waves, tsunamis, or rising water) is usually excluded from the Comprehensive Policy, many other types of water damage are either covered or can be covered with the purchase of an endorsement (see Section 7.8.8.1 below).

To many homeowners, any type of water damage is known as a flood. As a broker, be diligent in understanding the various forms of water damage endorsements — such as ground water, overland flooding, sewer backup, and water escape protection — that you should offer to clients.

7.8.8.1 Sewer Backup/Water Escape Coverage

Exclusion 19c states that loss or damage is not covered if caused by the backing up or escape of water from a sewer, sump, or septic tank. This is a very important coverage to add to any policy, because basements in houses have gone far beyond being mere storage and furnace rooms. They are now an integral part of the living area of many houses.

Sewer backup claims used to be a matter of pumping out the water and washing the contents. We now realize that this effluent causes serious damage, requiring sophisticated and very expensive cleanup in some cases. Contents are now mostly disposed of, increasing claim costs. The coverage extends to include water escape from eavestroughs or downspouts, or from the melting of ice or snow on the exterior of the roof. As houses are built closer together and storms become more violent, there is an increased chance of sewer systems being overwhelmed.

The premium for this coverage will vary, based on the prior risk experience of the location. For example, risks in locations with old, inefficient sewer systems will pay a higher premium for the endorsement than risks in locations with updated infrastructure and a better claims experience.

7.8.9 Mass Evacuation Coverage

This endorsement will pay for all necessary and reasonable increases in living expenses if a civil authority proclaims an order for mass evacuation as a direct result of a sudden and accidental event in Canada or the continental United States. The amount of mass evacuation coverage will not be limited, up to a maximum of two weeks.

Exclusions to mass evacuation coverage are:

• Flood.

• Earthquake.

• War.

• Nuclear incident.

7.8.10 Vacancy Permit

Normally, the habitational policy excludes any losses that occur after the insured property is vacant, to the insured’s knowledge, for more than 30 consecutive days. This endorsement allows the insured dwelling to be vacant beyond 30 days, but only for the following perils:

• Fire or lightning.

• Explosion.

• Smoke.

• Falling object.

• Impact by non-owned aircraft or land vehicle.

• Riot.

• Windstorm or hail.

Vandalism and water damage are important perils not covered above. It’s important to note that vacant properties pose a greater hazard than occupied properties, particularly because they present an allurement to children and vandals. This endorsement may be difficult to obtain, and it is generally very costly. Since it is not high on many insurance companies’ list of acceptable risks, it normally carries a very high deductible.

7.8.11 Home Business Extension Endorsement

The way the world operates is changing rapidly, and we are seeing a blurring of the line between business and residential use of buildings. People no longer have to “go to work” to work: the digitization of the workplace has allowed the home to become an extension of the office. The line is also blurring between business equipment and personal items, as personal cell phones and home laptops become remote workstations.

The insured may assume that, because they have a Comprehensive Policy, they are covered for everything — but this is not the case. The Comprehensive Homeowner, Tenant, Condominium Unit Owner Package Policy has exclusions relating to business use of the property. It includes limited coverage for books, tools, and instruments pertaining to a business, and there are exclusions in Section II: Liability Coverages for business and business property. On the other hand, the purchase of a commercial policy is not suitable in these situations, either: the coverage is too broad and may not be appropriate, and the premium is very high relative to the risk.

The Home Business Extension was introduced to meet this new reality. It amends the exclusions in the habitational policy to fit the business use of the premises. Every insurance company has a different form, and their underwriting considerations will include the type of business, values of the business property, annual sales/receipts, and details of security. Not all classes of home-based business are eligible for these policies, and some may ultimately require a commercial policy.

Note: It is important to recognize that some home-based businesses may compromise the acceptability of the habitational risk. What may seem perfectly acceptable to an insured may not be to an insurance company. Brokers should always make themselves aware of what the insured is doing with their property.

7.9 ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

7.9.1 Statutory Conditions

All the policy forms we have covered insure for the peril of fire. As a result, the Statutory Conditions must be added to every policy, as mandated by the Insurance Act.

As we learned in Chapter 5: Regulation of Insurance Contracts, the purpose of the Statutory Conditions is to make sure the relationship between both the insurer and the insured is standardized. When a claim occurs or when a policy is cancelled, there are certain rules to be followed by both parties to make sure no one is taken advantage of and the transaction is made in a fair and equitable manner. They cannot be changed or amended by any party to the contract. Brokers need to be fully aware of these conditions.

The headings for the Statutory Conditions are listed below, but you can refer back to Section 5.3: Part 2: Statutory Conditions for more information. Be sure to check the policy for the full wordings.

1) Misrepresentation.

2) Property of Others.

3) Change of Interest.

4) Material Change.

5) Termination.

6) Requirements after Loss.

7) Fraud.

8) Who May Give Notice and Proof.

9) Salvage.

10) Entry, Control, and Abandonment.

11) Appraisal.

12) When Loss Payable.

13) Replacement.

14) Action.

15) Notice.

7.9.2 Additional Conditions

Several of the conditions below have been covered in earlier sections.

• Notice to authorities: When the cause of the loss is due to certain criminal acts, the insured must give immediate notice to the police or other authorities having jurisdiction. This gives authorities a greater chance of recovering items that have been stolen and can help to reduce the amount of the claim paid.

• No benefit to bailee: This condition enables the insurer to recover any payments made from such parties when they are responsible for loss to insured property.

• Pair and set: When there is loss or damage to only one item of a pair or set, the loss is not a total loss.

• Parts: This condition states that when there is a loss or damage to a part of insured property that consists of several parts or components, the insurer will pay for the replacement of the lost or damaged part only, including the cost of installation.

• Sue and labour: The insured must take all reasonable steps to recover lost property. The insurer agrees to contribute pro rata towards any reasonable and proper expenses in connection with such efforts.

• Basis of settlement: ACV, unless otherwise stated.

• Subrogation: When the insurer pays a claim for damage caused to the insured’s property by others, it is entitled to seek recovery from the responsible party. The insurer agrees not to exercise the right of subrogation against any party having an insurable interest in the property insured.

7.11 CONCLUSION

This brings us to the end of our overview of personal property insurance. As you’ve probably learned, personal property is a big topic! You’ll come across these coverages, and the logic and principles behind them, again in later chapters. In the meantime, use this chapter’s glossary and review quiz to test your knowledge. Good luck!

8.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we will cover the background, guiding principles, and operational structure of how liability insurance works in Canada and, specifically, Ontario. But let’s start with a brief history lesson.

8.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF BRITISH AND FRENCH SETTLEMENT IN CANADA

Image

Canada officially became a country in 1867 with the signing of the British North America Act —but our history, and the relationship between the French and the English, goes back even further. It is that history that has shaped the legal systems in Canada.

Much of North America, from the Maritimes to the St. Lawrence River valley in eastern Canada to large swaths of American land along the Mississippi River, was colonized by France starting in the 16th century. (Great Britain, through the Hudson’s Bay Company, controlled the northern lands draining into Hudson Bay.) French control of the colonies from afar led to a very tumultuous existence. nevertheless, French laws and customs were ingrained in the residents along the St. Lawrence.20

When the British defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City in 1759, they gained control over the whole country. The Quebec Act 1774 gave certain rights to the French in the newly English controlled Canada. The French inhabitants were allowed certain controls over their own religion, education, and laws. Canada eventually split into Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec) in 1791.

8.2.1 Civil Code and Common Law Systems

Though French colonialism had ended by the early 1800s, many generations of French Canadians had settled in Canada by that time. The French influence in Lower Canada resulted in the use of the civil law, as was used in France. The English ruling governors decided to leave these areas of Canada under local governance and law. Finally, in 1866, Quebec’s civil laws were codified under the Civil Code of Lower Canada.21 (This was replaced by the Civil Code of Quebec in 1994.)

Meanwhile, in Upper Canada and the Maritime provinces, the controlling influence was the British Parliament and the Church of England. As a result, British common law was established in the rest of Canada. Quebec prospered under its Civil Code, while the rest of the country developed under common law, and these two legal systems have endured to the present day. (However, criminal disputes and federal matters are governed by the common law system.)

Quebec’s Civil Code is a body of law containing a series of articles, which comprise all matters that might give rise to a dispute. When a court settles a dispute under the Civil Code, the appropriate article is selected, and a decision is made based on it. Theoretically, the court does not need to follow the decision made in a similar case, but in practice, the court does consider the interpretation of the same article made by earlier courts.

In contrast, common law judges are required to give written reasons for their decisions, and these reasons become part of the public record of the law (also known as “case law” or “precedent”). Precedents often vary from one area to another, so ultimately courts have to decide which precedent is the most appropriate for any given situation. Case law is a dynamic system and is constantly evolving.

In civil matters, under both common law and Civil Code, a judgment is rendered based on a previous decision, whether written in the Civil Code or in a prior common law decision. Both systems are flexible enough to deal with how our society is evolving.

8.3 LEGAL CATEGORIES

Civilized societies need codified laws to function properly. The more evolving and complex a society, the more complex the system to deal with disputes. Laws are created to govern society and the interaction of people. Without rules, we might find ourselves in total chaos in our daily activities. When these rules are violated, those responsible must account for their actions.

In Canada, we have two categories of law to govern society: criminal law and civil law. Let’s explore these in greater detail.

8.3.1 Criminal Law

Criminal law deals with wrongs against society. It relies on a system of punishment as a means of enforcing its many rules, which are defined in the Criminal Code. Violators are prosecuted in the criminal courts by a prosecuting counsel. The penalties for violation of society’s laws are generally fines, penalties, imprisonment, or probation.

Examples of criminal wrongs include:

• Murder.

• Manslaughter.

• Burglary, robbery, and theft.

• Possession and trafficking of drugs.

Criminal law seeks to determine guilt, which means it is rarely concerned with compensating the victim of a criminal act for the wrong they suffered. All provinces and territories are subject to the same laws regarding criminal wrongs.

Notably, insurance companies do not insure the financial consequences arising out of criminal acts caused by the insured. Therefore, we will not be discussing criminal law further in this textbook.

8.3.2 Civil Law

Civil law is concerned with settling disputes between individuals or other legal entities that do not involve a criminal act. When a dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation between the parties, it can proceed to a civil court, which will provide a ruling in accordance with the legal principles involved. It provides a judicial forum to assign fault by interpreting and developing common law principles and applying the relevant statute law.

The courts will become involved only when the plaintiff (the party complaining) initiates the action against the defendant (the party alleged to have committed the wrong). The goal in any civil action is to seek compensation for the financial loss or damage suffered by the wronged party. For our purposes, we will be discussing civil law under the common law system only.

In common law, the current court decision must follow previous decisions made in cases having similar circumstances — this is known as the rule of precedent. The idea underlying common law is to develop, through successive judicial decisions, a logical body of general principles that can be used to compare specific cases. Relying on legal precedent ensures that justice is dispensed in an even-handed and consistent fashion. However, circumstances change and a precedent established many years ago may no longer be considered legally, socially, or equitably valid. Sometimes, a precedent is overturned and a new one is established.

Government statutes can also impose civil liability. Statutes are written laws derived from bills introduced into Parliament and provincial legislative assemblies to deal with specific needs. When passed, these laws take priority over any existing common law dealing with the same matter. While the breach of certain statutes (such as the Criminal Code) constitutes a criminal act, many statutes are concerned only with clarification for matters of civil liability. For example, the purpose of the Occupiers’ Liability Act enacted in many provinces is to define the responsibilities of occupiers for the condition and use of their premises.

Within civil law, there are two branches: contract law and tort law.

8.3.2.1 Contract Law

As we’ve learned, a contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties. It is a private bargain, and the terms are intended to express the intentions of those parties.

Parties to a contract enter into obligations. These obligations are not set out by law; rather, they serve to reflect the parties’ private intent. In a contract law dispute, the civil court requires parties of the contract to show that they fulfilled their obligations.

As we discuss liability insurance, we will not be dealing with contract law. Instead, we’ll focus our attention on tort law.

8.3.2.2 Tort Law

A tort is a wrong done to another in breach of a duty laid down by law. It is defined as “a wrongful act which has negligently caused damage or injury to another. This wrongful act may be an intentional act, a negligent act or a failure to act.”22 Importantly, a tort is not a breach of a contract.

The principles of common law make people responsible to their neighbours and to others for certain acts resulting in injury to them or damage to their property. For example, the operator of an automobile is responsible in law to anyone who might be injured through its negligent operation. A person who commits a wrong is known as a tort-feasor. When two or more parties act together to cause injury or damage, they are called joint tort-feasors.

Many torts or private wrongs are remedied in civil court, such as:

• Trespass.

• Nuisance.

• Defamation (libel and slander).

• Negligence.

8.3.2.2.1 Elements of a Tort

There are three elements required in every tort action. If any one element is missing, no tort or wrong has occurred.

1) Legal duty owed: This element presupposes that one party has the right not to be harmed unreasonably and the other party has a duty to refrain from causing harm. This must be a non-contractual right, otherwise it would place the situation within the area of contract law. The defendant (the tort-feasor) owed the plaintiff (the injured party) a legal duty.

2) That duty is breached: There must be a violation of the right to be free from harm or a breach of the duty not to harm. The court will attempt to determine if there was a breach of that legal duty owed to the plaintiff.

3) Damages were suffered as a proximate result of the defendant’s (tort-feasor’s) action: There must be some injury or damage caused to the person having the right to be free from harm. The proximate cause rule states there is a chain of events uninterrupted, without the introduction of another primary cause, from the initial act to its conclusion.23

For example:

Tomomi slipped on ice in a shopping mall parking lot and broke her ankle. While attempting to reach the mall to receive first aid, she was struck by a vehicle, sustaining further damage. If the court rules against the mall, the only damages they will be required to pay will relate to the broken ankle. The subsequent damages would relate to the car accident.

Note: Beyond our discussion of the elements of torts, there is a concept of Concurrent Causation, which means that at times there may be concurrent causes which act together to cause injury or damage which would not have resulted in the absence of either. Concurrent causation involves two distinct causes, operating simultaneously, to produce a given result.

An example of concurrent causation is if strong winds from a hurricane damage a house structure, then a sudden blast of wind blows open the front door and allows heavy rain water to flood the entrance.

8.3.2.2.2 Classification of Torts

Torts can be broken down into two major classes: intentional torts and unintentional torts.

1) Intentional torts require:

• The actual intent to invade the rights of the victim. For example, a battery or a physical attack upon a person is an intentional tort against a person’s freedom from bodily injury.

• An intentional undertaking that would reasonably be expected to result in injury or damage.

Payment for damage intentionally caused is excluded from liability policies.

2) Unintentional torts require:

• A careless, rather than intentional, invasion of another’s rights. When injury or damage results, the person wronged is entitled to sue for damages.

This carelessness, or negligence, in unintentional torts is addressed by the tort of negligence. Negligence is the most common tort, and it is the most important tort in the study of liability insurance.

8.3.2.2.2.1 Negligence

Black’s Law Dictionary defines negligence as “the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those ordinary considerations which ordinarily regulate human affairs, would do, or the doing of something which a reasonable and prudent man would not do.”24

The law does not demand perfection to be the standard by which a negligent act is judged. It only asks what a “reasonable” person would do — that is, the standard adopted in the community by persons of ordinary intelligence and prudence.25 Failing to act in this reasonable manner can constitute a negligent action.

A person is negligent only if the results of the act, or failure to act, could have reasonably been expected or foreseen — that is, if they knew or should have known that their conduct involved an unreasonable risk of harm. Lighting a fire outside on a windy day with a fire ban in place would constitute an expected unreasonable risk.26

8.3.2.2.2.1.1 Onus of Proof

The law generally holds individuals innocent until proven guilty. This is true in criminal law, but it also applies to civil law cases involving negligence, where the responsibility for proving the case falls upon the plaintiff.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. In the following situations, the onus of proof falls on the defendant:

• Statute law: Statutes created by provincial and federal governments may impose strict liability. The provincial Highway Traffic Acts (concerning vehicular accidents involving pedestrians) normally assume the defendant is guilty unless proven innocent.

• Res ipsa loquitur (“The thing speaks for itself”): If a car parked next to a building being spray painted is covered in paint at the end of the day, the painters would have to prove they did not cause the damage.

• Absolute liability: Certain activities have been determined by legislation or common law to create liability without regard to fault. These are normally activities in which harm to others would result if a mishap occurred. The person undertaking the activity should understand the potential dangers, and it is reasonable to hold that person strictly accountable if someone is harmed. Examples of absolute liability include keeping a dangerous or wild animal, storing or transporting excessive amounts of flammables or noxious substances in a populated area, or allowing the spread of an intentionally set fire (see Section 9.3.8.3.6: Absolute Liability). Absolute liability is also known as strict liability.

Even though these situations shift the onus of proof to the defendant, there are conditions that absolve this shifting of the burden:

• A force majeure, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or flood.

• The plaintiff’s own actions created the situation to arise.

• The activity was a deliberate action by the third party (or plaintiff).

• The plaintiff consented to the activity giving rise to the damages.

Unless the activity is expressly excluded, liability insurance policies generally respond to pay for injuries or damages arising out of activities that the insureds might be held strictly liable for.

8.4 LIABILITY

8.4.1 Liability Coverage Flow Chart

We’ve covered a lot so far, so let’s step back and look at how a liability policy will provide coverage for an act that broke the law. Follow the arrows to determine whether an action is covered under a policy’s liability coverage.

8.4.2 Insurers’ Responsibility for Damages

A legal action usually results in great financial hardship to those involved. In a civil suit, where the goal of the action is to seek compensation for the amount of the injury or damage, a judgment against the insured could result in a considerable loss of wealth. Generally, the amount of the monetary award provided by the courts is referred to as “damages.”

Insurance companies are prepared to assume the financial responsibility of others when they fail to comply with certain of society’s laws. The following are general guidelines:

• Criminal acts caused by insureds are not insurable. There is no policy that agrees to pay fines or penalties assessed by the court for injury or damages caused by an insured’s criminal activity.

• Civil liabilities are insurable. In these cases, insurance companies will assume the financial responsibilities not only of individuals, but of other legal entities — such as associations, corporations, and governments — for their torts. As we learned earlier, there are many types of torts, but the most important is the tort of negligence.

Note: The information provided here regarding torts, negligence, and liability is of a general nature. It is up to qualified legal practitioners and the various courts — not insurance brokers — to determine the outcome of matters of tort and negligence.

However, because of the legal nature of liability, insurance brokers must have a basic understanding of the law. This knowledge will help brokers identify their client’s liability exposure and recommend the appropriate protection. In order to do that, brokers need to be aware of a few important precedents that will give rise to liability exposures.

8.4.3 Important Precedents

8.4.3.1 Persons on the Premises

Under common law, when persons are injured, their rights depend upon the circumstance under which they came to be on the premises. There are established categories of duty for the occupier or owner of that property. The standard of duty of care required to be exercised by the occupier will not necessarily be the same for all persons entering the property.

There are several categories for persons entering premises:

• Trespasser: A trespasser is a person who is on another person’s premises for their own purposes without the express or implied permission of the occupier. Their presence is of no value to the occupier and such a person is viewed as having temporarily appropriated the property for their own use. The law places no legal duty on the occupier of the premises for the safety of the trespasser, except they cannot set traps or intentionally cause harm to the trespasser.

• Visitor (applicable to Ontario): The Occupiers’ Liability Act has amended the common law terms of “licensee” and “invitee,” classifying them within the heading of “visitor.” A visitor is anyone who enters the premises other than a trespasser. Occupiers must ensure that all visitors are reasonably safe in using the premises.

• Children: In common law, the accepted legal position is that children lack the mature judgment needed to avoid risk and therefore need to be protected. Certain property, such as construction sites, attract children by their very nature. This is often referred to as an “attractive nuisance” or an “allurement.”

8.4.3.2 Persons Outside the Premises

• Neighbours and passers-by: Neighbours and passers-by can sustain injury or damage as a result of the condition of the occupier’s premises or the activities conducted inside. If property is used in a normal manner, occupiers are expected to maintain their buildings and land to avoid the escape of water, sewage, or other obnoxious matter to the detriment of neighbours. Occupiers who bring dangerous items onto their property and allow them to escape could be held strictly liable for damage or injury to others.

8.4.3.3 Domestic Animals

A large number of claims for injury or damage caused by domestic animals deal with dogs and, in particular, dog bites to innocent third parties. In 1981, an Ontario court ruling held there is no first free bite, and a dog’s owner is deemed legally liable from the first bite. In some municipalities, certain dog breeds have been deemed dangerous, and this has impacted the rating on some liability insurance policies. Zoos and other parties that keep wild animals shall be held strictly liable for injury or damage inflicted by that animal either on or off premises.

8.4.3.4 Children

The activities of children have been the source of numerous bodily injury and property damage claims. Children playing with matches have been responsible for losses to vacant properties, schools, and other buildings. Their careless use of firearms and motorized recreational vehicles has also resulted in permanent injury and death to playmates, friends, and others. In common law, children are responsible for the bodily injury and property damage they cause, unless it can be proven in the courts they were incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions.

Children are responsible for their own torts. Parents are not generally required to pay for the torts of their children, unless it can be shown there was a:

• Failure to properly supervise and control their child’s activities.

• The injury or damage was caused by a dangerous thing or animal relinquished by the parent to the control of the child.

• The injury or damage was caused by a child acting on the authority of the parent.

• The injury or damage arose out of the duties of employment in the parent’s business.

8.4.3.5 Landlords

In common law, landlords are not responsible for ensuring that a building or land rented to others is fit for the purpose for which it is rented, unless they specifically warrant the fitness for such purpose or conceal any adverse conditions.

Exceptions to this are:

• When a landlord rents furnished premises to a tenant, it is presumed that the premises are fit for the purpose leased at the outset of the tenancy.

• If the landlord has contracted to maintain the premises and fails, after reasonable notice to do so, any injury or damage to property of the tenants is the responsibility of the landlord. In buildings having multiple tenancies, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the condition of the areas common to all tenants, including roof, stairways, parking areas, and lobbies.

8.4.3.6 Tenants to Landlord

A business which operates out of rented premises faces the potential for liability for loss or damage to the building. The tenant’s responsibility for such loss may be addressed in:

• Tort law: If a tenant is liable in tort for damage caused, the building owner is entitled to compensation. For example, when damage arises out of the tenant’s negligence, the tenant will be liable to the landlord for damages.

• Contract law: In most instances, the extent of a tenant’s liability for loss will be stated in a contract, such as a rental or lease agreement with the building owner.

8.4.3.7 Bailees

A bailee for hire is someone who has the temporary custody of the personal belonging of another for a purpose other than the sale of that item and who is compensated for caring, servicing, or fixing such property. For example, dry cleaners, garages, trucking companies, and delivery firms are all bailees. There is a potential for loss to the property in the bailee’s possession. Under tort law, bailees are required to exercise the same care over the property as would be exercised by others in the same business. They become responsible if that ordinary care is breached by their negligence. Under contract law, that duty of care is assumed under a separate contract.

8.4.3.8 Employers to Employees

In common law, employers are be held liable for the torts of their employees during their employment. This is known as “vicarious liability,” where one party has the indirect legal responsibility for the acts of another.

However, there is an exception when the employee acts outside the scope of their duties. In these situations, there is no liability when an employee delegates any or all of their work without the employer’s consent, when they take time off from their duties to attend to personal matters, or when they use the employer’s property for their own use and cause damage.

8.4.3.9 Independent Contractors

People who hire contractors to do work on their premises will generally be named in a legal action if the work being performed results in injury or damage to others. The status of the person doing the work determines the extent of the owner’s liability when injury or damage results from that work. Generally, occupiers of property are not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor if it can be shown that reasonable care was exercised in the selection of the independent contractor and it was reasonable that the work the independent contractor was engaged to do should have been undertaken. The exceptions are when the work was inherently dangerous; the independent contractor was using defective fixtures, machinery, or equipment supplied by the occupier; or the occupier controlled the manner in which the work was to be done.

8.4.3.10 Joint Liability

Injury or damage may not always result from the actions of a single person. When two or more persons act negligently to cause injury or damage to others, they are called “joint tort-feasors,” meaning that they are jointly liable. The onus placed on persons working together is the same as if they were working alone. Reasonable care must be taken to ensure that injury or damage does not result out of their actions.

When there are two or more tort-feasors, disputes concerning the apportionment of damages could take a long time to resolve and may involve a separate legal action between the tort-feasors themselves. To ensure that the plaintiffs receive the damages awarded to them as soon as possible, the law provides that when equal liability is disputed, each tort-feasor will be held liable for the entire amount of the award. In order that the plaintiff does not receive twice the amount due, the tort-feasors’ insurers would be prompted to each pay 50% of the damages and settle their own concerns between themselves or, if required, through the courts.

8.5 THE INSURING AGREEMENT

As you’ve learned, the insurance process involves an analysis of the risks presented by the insured. In the past few chapters, we’ve discussed some of the risks presented by the ownership of property and the actions of the insureds. It is important to identify and determine which risks can appropriately be transferred to the insurance company and which may not be covered due to the risk presented. There may also be exclusions under the policy wording. In those cases, the insured may have to self-insure.

A liability policy generally deals with specific activities and is not designed to insure all exposures faced by insureds. Generally, a separate policy will be required for each of the insured’s personal, business, professional, and automobile liabilities.

Most insurance companies include liability coverages in their habitational policies. This eliminates the need for homeowners, condominium unit owners, or tenants to purchase a separate policy for their liability exposure. This is Section II: Liability Coverages in the Homeowner Policy Booklet. Automobile liability is part of the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1) and is mandatory (we’ll cover the OAP 1 in detail in Chapter 9: Automobile Insurance). Commercial policies treat liability as a separate policy form, as most policies need to be tailored to the risks presented by the business (we’ll explore this in Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance).

Insuring agreements transfer these risks to the insurance company. The agreement sets out the relationship between the insured and the insurer. There are common features to all insurance policies, be they automobile, personal property, or business liability. For example, the main insuring agreement on most liability policies can be summarized as follows:

“The insurer agrees to pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay to third parties as compensatory payment for bodily injury or property damage. It must be caused by an occurrence; it must occur during the policy period, and it must take place in the coverage territory.”

Additionally, it is important to understand each of the seven underlined parts of the agreement. Let’s explore them in detail.

8.5.1 Pay All Sums Legally Obligated to Pay

It is up to the courts to determine the legal obligation of the insured either in tort or contract as to their obligation to a third party. Though an insured may feel they have a moral obligation to make a payment to an injured third party, the policy will only respond when the insured is responsible. Negligence must be established.

8.5.2 To Third Parties

The coverage provided by liability policies is described as third-party coverage. While property insurance policies provide payment directly to the owner of the property lost or damaged, liability policies indemnify the insured for payments to others for which the insured is legally liable. Black’s Law Dictionary defines a third party as “one who is not a party to the agreement or to a transaction but who may have rights therein.”27 If an insured were to slip and injure themselves on their own property, they could not make claim on their own policy.

8.5.3 For Compensatory Damages

There are three types of damages classified as compensatory. Each is meant to compensate for the injury or damage caused by the defendant to the plaintiff. The compensation will be assessed in terms of money.

1) General damages: These are subject to interpretation and are for such items as pain and suffering, loss of limbs, damage to reputation, or mental anguish. It reflects the amount the court believes necessary to compensate the aggrieved party fairly.

2) Special damages: These are quantifiable and can be accurately measured. They are specific to medical, rehabilitation, and other like damages.

3) Nominal damages: These are for personal injuries, such as libel and slander.

Punitive or exemplary damages are not covered. These are damages intended to punish a defendant for their actions and serve to deter others from similar behaviour in the future. Payments for these damages are borne by the insured themselves.

8.5.4 For Bodily Injury and Property Damage

The definition of “bodily injury” is very broad. It refers to physical injury sustained and associated with external causes. It includes not only physical injury (such as a slip and fall at a residence) but sickness, disease, and death. It can also include personal injury, such as being detained by a store detective on suspicion of shoplifting, or slander or libel.

Damage to property includes the loss of use of that property. When a person’s negligent act causes physical damage to property, the actual costs to repair or replace that property — including additional expenses incurred in continuing to live or do business at another location — can be claimed from that party.

8.5.5 Caused by an Occurrence

An occurrence is defined as an event that occurs suddenly and unexpectedly which can be fixed in time, or that occurs over a long period of time. The first part of the definition is straightforward, while the second part refers to “the continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions” — for example, repeated exposure to coal dust or asbestos resulting in lung disease such as cancer.

8.5.6 During the Policy Period

The insurer will respond to claims occurring during the period the policy was in force.

8.5.7 Within the Coverage Territory

In personal lines insurance, the coverage applies worldwide; on a commercial policy, there may be geographical restrictions, such as within Canada or the United States and its territories. When dealing with commercial risks, the broker must ascertain a company’s trading area to ensure the proper coverage.

8.6 SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS

The limit of insurance provided by the policy for bodily injury and property damage is reserved for the payment of claims. However, there are additional expenses incurred by both the insurers and insured in investigating, settling, and defending a claim. These expenses are provided under a separate insuring agreement known as “supplementary payments.” These are included in all of the liability policies we will be studying and follow from the insuring agreement.

Supplementary payments are extremely important for all insureds. They are usually not limited to any specific amount and, with most policies, they are provided in addition to other coverage limits.

8.7 THE COMPREHENSIVE HOMEOWNER, TENANT, CONDOMINIUM UNIT OWNER PACKAGE POLICY

For this discussion of personal liability, we are using the Comprehensive Homeowner, Tenant, Condominium Unit Owner Package Policy. This section will give you a general overview of the coverages, limits, and exclusions applicable to this policy form.

Whereas the automobile policy, OAP 1, is governed by statute law and is the same for everyone, this is not the case for property policies. In addition, each insurance company will have their own policy form. As we learned in Chapter 7: Property Insurance, brokers must be aware of these differences and provide the most appropriate policy with the best coverages for their client.

Most insurance companies include the liability coverages in the property policy, which means there is no need for the insured to purchase a separate policy. This liability coverage is the same for all three policy forms and is shown under Section II: Liability Coverages. There is one liability coverage exclusive to condominium unit owners, but otherwise, we need to learn only the one form and apply it to all three policy forms.

The liability coverages under the Homeowner Policy are as follows:

• Coverage E: Personal Liability.

• Coverage F: Voluntary Medical Payments.

• Coverage G: Voluntary Payment for Damage to Property.

• Coverage H: Voluntary Compensation for Residence Employees.

• Coverage I: Loss Assessment (applicable to condominium unit owners only).

The limit of insurance for each of the five coverages is indicated on the coverage summary page. Insurers set their own minimum limits for each of the coverages, and insureds cannot buy less than that amount. For example, most insurers provide the following limits:
Coverage 	Amount
Coverage E: Personal Liability 	$1,000,000
Coverage F: Voluntary Medical Payment 	$5,000
Coverage G: Voluntary Payment for Damage to Property 	$1,000
Coverage H: Voluntary Compensation 	As per the Schedule
Coverage I: Loss Assessment (applicable to condominium unit owners only) 	250% of Coverage A1

Coverage E: Personal Liability can be increased for an additional fee. The other coverages usually remain at the limit shown on the policy. These coverages are not normally subject to a deductible; however, an insured with a history of claims may have a deductible applied as an underwriting criterion for continuing coverage.

Every policy has its own set of definitions and exclusions particular to that policy. Because of the nature of liability insurance, some of the definitions from Section I: Property Coverages need to be expanded and clarified. There are exclusions specific to liability insurance, as the policy is not meant to provide coverage for every situation an insured may find themselves in. Refer to pages 15 to 24 of the Homeowner Policy Booklet for the actual wordings.

8.7.1 Key Definitions

The following are key definitions for the liability policies:

• Person insured: The persons shown as insureds under Section I: Property Coverages are also insured under this section. However, coverage is extended to include the following:

- Any person or organization legally liable for damages caused by a watercraft or animal owned by the insured and to which this insurance applies. This does not include anyone using or having custody of the watercraft or animal in the course of any business or without the owner’s permission. For example, a person caring for a neighbour’s dog or a friend driving the boat at the cottage would be covered. A professional dog walker or a marina operator in the course of their business would not be covered.

- A residence employee while performing duties in connection with the ownership, use, or operation of motorized vehicles or trailers for which coverage is provided by this form. Motorized vehicles include such items as lawn mowers, garden tractors and their trailers, and snow blowers.

- The insured’s legal representative having temporary custody of the insured premises, if the insured dies while insured by this form, for legal liability arising out of the premises. Liability arising out of the maintenance or use of the insured’s property is covered. The executor of the estate is automatically covered.

- Any person who is insured by this form at the time of the insured’s death and who continues residing on the insured’s premises.

• Premises insured: Section I: Property Coverages defines “premises,” in the case of a homeowner, as the dwelling and the land contained within the lot lines on which the dwelling is situated. In the case of the condominium unit owner or tenant, this means the dwelling or unit, including garages, outbuildings, and private approaches reserved for their use or occupancy only.

However, Section II: Liability Coverages broadens this definition to include other locations, including all premises where the insured maintains a residence, including seasonal or other residences, provided such premises are specifically described on the coverage summary page.

It also includes:

• Premises where the insured is residing temporarily or which the insured is using temporarily, as long as they are not the owner of the premises or the lessee or tenant of the premises under any agreement which is longer than 180 consecutive days.

• Premises in Canada to be occupied by the insured as their principal residence, from the date they acquire ownership or take possession but not beyond the earliest of:

60 consecutive days.

- The date the policy expires or is terminated.

- The date upon which specific liability insurance is arranged for such premises.

• Individual or family cemetery plots or burial vaults.

• Vacant land in Canada the insured owns or rents, other than farmland.

• Land in Canada where an independent contractor is building a one-, two- or three-family residence to be occupied by the insured.

8.7.2 Coverage E: Personal Liability

Personal liability coverage is designed to insure the legal liability of insureds in their role as private citizens while anywhere in the world. Accidental injury or damage caused by insureds — for example, while on holidays; at public meetings; or while shopping, fishing, golfing or playing ball — are included within the kinds of private wrongs insured by this insuring agreement.

Coverage is provided for injury or damage arising out of the ownership, use, or occupancy of all premises insured by this section. The condition of the insured’s premises and the activities conducted on them are major sources of liability claims.

Examples of losses covered by the policy include:

• Drowning of a neighbour’s child in the insured’s swimming pool or hot tub.

• Injury to a passer-by caused by the insured’s dog.

• Guest injured when the railing on the back deck collapsed and the guest fell.

Claims for injury or death sustained by a residence employee are also covered. Currently, there is no requirement to enroll these employees in the provincial workers’ compensation plan. As the population ages, there will probably be a greater number of residence employees engaged in households. These employees are entitled to compensation from the insured when they can show that the insured was legally liable for their injuries. This employer’s liability exposure is insured by this policy.

We have noted that every policy has exclusions, as no policy can be so broad as to cover every situation. Under Coverage E: Personal Liability, the following exclusions apply:

• Liability that the insured has assumed by contract, unless the insured’s legal liability would have applied even if no contract had been in force. However, insurance companies do insure claims made against the insured for the legal liability of other persons in relation to the insured’s premises that have been assumed under a written contract. In other words, the insured cannot voluntarily assume the liability of others and expect their insurer to pay for the injury or damage caused by such persons. And there are exceptions to this rule, as well: for example, when the insured would have been liable anyway or when the liability being assumed is related to the insured’s premises.

• Damage to property owned by an insured. This will be insured under Section I: Property Coverages of the policy.

• Damage to property used, occupied, leased, or rented by or in the care, custody, or control of an insured, except for the unintentional property damage to premises owned by others, or their contents which the insured is using, renting, or has in their custody or control caused by fire, explosion, water damage, or smoke. Courts recognize and enforce payment for harm done to property of others. Coverage is provided for unintentional property damage. This is called tenant’s legal liability. In personal insurance, this is included in the policy under Section E: Personal Liability; in commercial insurance, it must be purchased specifically. In the context above, “smoke” means due to a sudden, unusual, and faulty operation of any heating or cooking unit in or on the premises, but not smoke from a fireplace. Water damage has the same meaning as under Section I: Property Coverages.

• Damage to personal property or fixtures as a result of work done on them by the insured or anyone on their behalf.

• Bodily injury to the insured or to any person residing in their household other than a residence employee.

• The personal actions of a named insured who does not reside on the premises as described on the coverage summary page.

8.7.2.1 Defence, Settlement, Supplementary Payments

Under all liability policies, the insurer agrees to pay all costs associated with the defence and settlement of claims (including the following supplemental payments), even if the claim made against the insured is groundless or without merit. The insurer agrees to investigate, negotiate, and settle any claim they decide is appropriate and will only pay for the legal counsel of the insured that the insurer selects. For example, if the investigation conducted by the insurer leads it to believe the plaintiff would be successful in a legal action against the insured, the insurer may offer to settle the claim out of court. This right exists even though the insured might claim they are not responsible for the injury or damage.

The limit of insurance purchased by the insured and shown under Section E: Personal Liability is reserved for the payment of the judgment against them and cannot be used for any other purposes. The amount provided by this additional insuring agreement is over and above that limit.

The costs insured by this agreement include:

• Cost of defence. The actual legal costs to conduct a defence in a complicated action can total thousands of dollars. This agreement covers those expenses.

• Reasonable expenses incurred by the insured at the insurer’s request to assist in the investigation and defence of the claim, including all bonds as required by the court.

• Court costs assessed against the insured. The court may rule that the insured bears all the costs of both the plaintiff and the defendant.

• Interest from the date the judgment was rendered, but only on the amount which is within the limit of insurance provided by the policy.

• Expenses which the insured has incurred for the emergency medical or surgical treatment to others following an accident or occurrence insured by this form.

• The reasonable expenses — including actual loss of income up to $100 per day — which the insured incurs at the insurer’s request.

8.7.2.2 Obligations of Insureds after an Accident or Occurrence

When an accident or occurrence takes place, the insured must promptly give the insurer notice (in writing, if requested by the insurer). The notice must include the date, time, place, and circumstances of the accident or occurrence. It must also include the names and addresses of witnesses and potential claimants. Prompt notification allows the insurer to quickly assess the potential for a successful action against the insured. If the insurer believes it necessary, a written report may be required.

This prompt action ensures that the facts of the incident are fresh in everyone’s mind. An inspection of the accident site may reveal facts which might remove or reduce the responsibility for the loss from the insured. It is also important for the insurer to be allowed to interview witnesses as soon as possible to ensure that important details are not forgotten.

The insured must co-operate with the insurer in any legal action, including obtaining witnesses, information, and evidence about the accident or occurrence if the insurer asks the insured. The insured must also immediately send to the insurer legal documents and any other written communication they receive concerning the accident or occurrence. The insured must co-operate fully with the insurer in the preparation of the defence.

It is extremely important that copies of any demands, notices, summonses, or legal papers be forwarded immediately. These documents could allow the insurer to file an objection to the claim with the court.

The insured must not make any unauthorized payments except at their own cost, nor should they assume any obligation or incur expenses other than first aid expenses necessary at the time of the accident. The right to defend and settle rests with the insurer. Any payments an insured may make are an infringement of that right and are prohibited.

Though this is a general description of what to do after an accident, each of the following coverages has its own specific explanation of what to do after an accident or occurrence and should be consulted for clarification.

8.7.3 Coverage F: Voluntary Medical Payments

This insuring agreement provides for the payment of reasonable medical expenses when an insured unintentionally injures another person or if they are accidentally injured while on the insured’s premises. The types of claims for which payment will be made include surgical, dental, hospital, nursing, ambulance service, and funeral expenses.

The insurer agrees to voluntarily make such payment on the insured’s behalf. In other words, there is no requirement that the insured be legally liable for the injury before payment will be made. The payment is limited to the amount shown on the policy and is limited to one year from the date of the accident. Payments are not made when the injured person is covered by a provincial workers’ compensation plan, a hospitalization plan, or other private insurance plan. These payments are provided without regards to fault.

8.7.4 Coverage G: Voluntary Payment for Damage to Property

The insurer agrees to make a voluntary payment for property damage which has been unintentionally caused and for which the insured would not be legally liable. It will also reimburse others for the direct property damage caused intentionally by an insured 12 years of age or under.

It does not provide coverage for damage to property the insured or their tenants own or rent, damage to property insured under Section I: Property Coverages, or claims resulting from the loss of use, disappearance, or theft of the property.

8.7.5 Coverage H: Voluntary Compensation for Residence Employees

Coverage E: Personal Liability provides coverage for the insured’s legal liability for injury or death to a residence employee. However, when such employee is injured or killed through no fault of the insured, there is no coverage. Coverage H is designed to provide residence employees with limited benefits in such situations. (The Homeowner Policy Booklet contains a schedule of benefits).

These benefits include payment for:

• Loss of life, including funeral expenses.

• Temporary total disability.

• Permanent total disability.

• Injury benefits (weekly indemnity).

• Medical expenses.

The limits payable and the duration of payments vary with each of the above categories. These payments are made voluntarily. However, there is no obligation on the insurer to make payment in the following instances:

• When the residence employee or their representative refuses to accept these benefits.

• When the residence employee sues the insured.

A residence employee, or anyone acting on their behalf who accepts these benefits, must sign a release giving up any right to sue the insured. The insurer has the right to subrogate against anyone other than the insured who is responsible for the residence employee’s injury or death.

8.7.6 Coverage I: Loss Assessment (Applicable to Condominium Unit Owner Only)

The insurer will pay an additional amount up to 250% of Coverage A1 for the insured’s share of a special assessment if:

• The assessment is valid under the condominium corporation’s governing rules, and

• The assessment is made necessary by occurrence(s) to which Coverage E: Personal Liability applies.

The insurer will not pay for any part of an assessment made necessary by a deductible in the insurance policy of the condominium corporation.

8.7.7 Special Limitations

In Chapter 7 we learned that under Section I: Property Coverages, there are certain items of property and activities which are excluded as they are better insured under their own policy — for example, watercraft, motorized vehicles, business activities and its property, and aircraft. The Special Limitations section then puts coverage back on to specific items — such as owned watercraft, certain motorized vehicles, and business equipment — but with specific property limits assigned to each one. Since these items have now been put back onto the policy, we must provide liability coverage to these items. Each item has liability coverage restrictions.

8.7.7.1 Watercraft and Motorized Vehicles

For any watercraft and motorized vehicles owned by the insured, coverage is automatically provided for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of the following watercraft and motorized vehicles:

• Watercraft, including their attachments, equipped with an outboard motor or motors of not more than 12kW (16 hp) in total when used with or on a single watercraft.

• Watercraft, including their attachments, equipped with any other type of motor of not more than 38KW (50 hp).

• Non-motorized watercraft, including their attachments, not more than 8 metres (26 feet) in length.

Insureds who own watercraft must be advised of these coverage limitations. When the above specifications are exceeded, additional coverages must be purchased. In such cases, the details regarding the type and size of the watercraft or motors will be stated on the coverage summary page.

To ensure there are no gaps in coverage and to allow insureds a reasonable opportunity to put insurance coverage in place, newly acquired watercraft which exceed the special limitations stated in the policy are automatically covered for 30 days from the purchase date. If coverage is required after that date, the policy must be endorsed accordingly.

Let’s look at some of the other motorized vehicles that have special limits:

• Self-propelled lawn mowers, snow blowers, and garden-type tractors of not more than 19kW (25 hp). The limitation of coverage applies to motorized yard equipment which is self-propelled or capable of moving on its own. For example, insureds using push-type lawn mowers or snow blowers would not be affected by this limitation; however, if an insured owns maintenance equipment that exceeds these specifications, they must purchase additional coverage. Motorized golf carts while in use on a golf course. Coverage for injury or damage arising out of the use of owned golf carts is limited to accidents on the golf course. There is no coverage for the operation of golf carts on the insured’s premises or any location which is not a golf course.

• Motorized wheelchairs, including motorized scooters having more than two wheels and specifically designed for the carriage of a person who has a physical disability.

8.7.7.1.1 Non-Owned Watercraft and Motorized Vehicles

Coverages for watercraft and motorized vehicles not owned by the insured — for example, borrowed from a friend — are described below. “Non-owned” means it is not owned by anyone who is deemed an insured under the definition of an insured policy, as shown on page 1 of the policy. This coverage applies to an insured against claims arising out of their use or operation of:

• Any type of watercraft.

• Any self-propelled land vehicle, amphibious vehicle, or air cushion vehicle, provided that the vehicle is not subject to motor vehicle registration and is designed primarily for use off public roads. Examples of non-owned motorized vehicles for which liability coverage is provided include dirt bikes, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, and golf carts.

• Additionally, the motorized vehicle or watercraft must not be owned by any person insured by this policy.

Coverage is provided for injury or damage arising out of the use or operation of all non-owned watercraft. As with other property owned, used, occupied, or leased by the insured, there is no coverage for actual damage caused to the watercraft itself.

This is broader coverage than is provided to insureds who own their own watercraft. The logic is that insureds who own certain boats ought to know of their increased liability exposure and will have taken steps to put coverage in place. The same logic cannot be applied to an insured who may use nonowned watercraft. To ensure there are no gaps in coverage, the insurer agrees to cover the insured’s liability for injury or damage arising out of all non-owned watercraft, regardless of their type or size of motor(s).

As broad as the coverage may appear, there are certain watercraft and motorized vehicles that insurers will not insure. There is no coverage for injury or damage arising out of the use or operation of any watercraft or motorized vehicle — whether owned by the insured or not — while it is:

• Used for carrying passengers for compensation.

• Used for business purposes.

• Used in any race or speed test.

• Rented to others.

• Used or operated without the owner’s consent, if the insured is not the owner.

8.7.7.2 Trailers

Coverage is provided for injury or damage arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of any trailer or its equipment, provided such trailer is not attached to, carried on, or being towed by a motorized vehicle subject to motor vehicle registration. For example, injury or damage caused by a camper trailer which rolls off its site at a local campground could be insured by this policy. A house trailer parked beside the residence in the off-season could be used occasionally while parked. The trailer itself would not be covered, but liability arising from its use would be covered. Damage caused to others while the trailer is in motion, and becomes disconnected from a towing vehicle, would fall under the automobile policy.

8.7.7.3 Business and Business Property

Business is defined in the policy as “any continuous or regular pursuit undertaken for financial gain including a trade, profession or occupation.” Business activities of insureds are generally required to be covered under a commercial liability policy.

In the past, there was a clear division between the workplace and the home. As we learned in Section 7.8.11: Home Business Extension Endorsement, that line has blurred as the world of business has changed. Due to advanced digital communication tools, many people no longer commute to work, and their home now includes their workspace. In many cases, the business operates entirely out of the home environment.

Although business pursuits or business use of the premises are excluded under Section II: Liability Coverages, there are exceptions. The insurer agrees to provide coverage for liabilities relating to the following business activity scenarios:

• The insured’s personal actions during the course of their trade, profession, or occupation which are not related directly to their trade, profession, or occupation. For example, Cole is an accountant operating out of his home. If a client were to visit for an appointment and happened to be bitten by his dog, Cole would be covered for a claim arising from the dog bite. However, he would not be covered for his actions as an accountant, which would be covered under his professional liability policy.

• The occasional rental to others of the portion of the dwelling usually occupied by the insured as a private residence. If Nav goes to Florida for three months in the winter and rents out her premises while she is away, she would be covered for claims arising out of the dwelling premises.

• The rental to others of a one-, two-, or three-family dwelling usually occupied by the insured as a residence, provided no family unit includes more than two roomers or boarders. The rental of a spare room to one or two students would be covered.

• The rental of space in the insured’s residence to others for incidental office, school, or studio occupancy.

• The rental to others, or the holding for rent, of not more than three car spaces or stalls in garages or stables.

• The temporary or part-time business pursuits of an insured person under the age of 21. This provides coverage for summer lawn cutting, babysitting, or other temporary pursuits.

Claims arising from any other business pursuit or operation are insured only if liability coverage for it is shown on the coverage summary page.

8.7.8 Exclusions of Coverage

As we know, exclusions are the norm, and Section II: Liability Coverages is no exception. In addition to the list of exclusions, there is no coverage for claims arising from:

• War, invasion, or act of a foreign enemy.

• Business pursuits or any business use of the premises except as provided under the Business and Business Property section.

• The rendering or failure to render any professional service. The law puts a higher standard of duty on those having specialized skill or knowledge, and persons providing such service should purchase professional liability insurance.

• Bodily injury or property damage caused by any intentional or criminal act or failure to act by:

- Any person insured by this policy, or

- Any other person at the direction of any person insured by this policy.

• Sexual, physical, psychological, or emotional abuse from molestation or harassment, including corporal punishment by, at the direction of, or with the knowledge, of any person insured by this policy, or

- Failure of any person insured by this policy to take steps to prevent sexual, physical, psychological, or emotional abuse, molestation, harassment, or corporal punishment.

• The transmission of communicable disease by any person insured by the policy.

• The ownership, use, or operation of:

- Any aircraft.

- Premises used as an airport or landing facility and all activities related to either.

Note: Insurers have different property policies and, as such, may have different exclusions concerning the legal cultivation of cannabis. It is important to check the individual wordings for each company.

8.8 PERSONAL UMBRELLA POLICIES

“How much is too much?” is a question often asked when dealing with a product such as liability insurance. Though many companies have a minimum limit to be applied to all policies, the upper limit is variable and depends on the exposures presented by the insured and the appetite of the company to provide a higher limit. A thorough analysis of an insured will show areas where a higher limit is required or where extra coverage is required because of an exclusion on the primary policy. For the insured, the risks may be identified and increased limits may be required, but the primary insurer may be unable to provide the limits and coverage that is required by the insured.

Image

Every insurer has limits on the amount of insurance it can write on a primary policy, be it property or automobile. They may have specific limits noted in their underwriting to control their exposures, or they may not have reinsurance in place to take on increased limits. This leaves the insured in a situation where they may have to purchase a separate policy to give themselves the increased protection they require. They can either purchase an excess policy or an umbrella policy.

An excess policy will provide the same coverages and exclusions as the primary policy and will only pay when the primary policy limits are exhausted. Where extra coverage is required because of an exclusion in the primary the insured can buy an umbrella policy.

To be eligible for an umbrella liability policy, insureds must provide the insurer with evidence that they already have existing or primary liability policies in place for any known exposures, such as automobile, watercraft, aviation, or residences.

When there is a claim, the umbrella liability policy will pay only when:

• There is not enough insurance under the primary policy. If the primary policy has a limit of $2 million, this limit must be exhausted before the umbrella policy pays in excess of this limit.

• There is no coverage provided under the primary policy. In this scenario, the umbrella policy will pay as the primary policy, provided it does not contain the same exclusions as the primary policy. This is called the “drop down” feature. In this case, there is a self-insured retention (SIR) amount (which varies from company to company) if this umbrella becomes the primary insurer. This SIR functions as a deductible.

8.9 OTHER LIABILITY POLICIES

8.9.1 Commercial Liability

The purpose of this section is to make you aware of the overall nature of commercial liability and to help you understand that it is much more complex in its coverages and application than the personal liability coverage we just described. We’ll cover a general overview of a commercial liability policy and some of its features. However, you’ll need to study beyond this textbook to serve the needs of a commercial client.

Just as a habitational policy is issued with personal liability included, so a commercial property policy includes commercial liability. While all habitational policies comprise the same policy coverages, commercial liability is underwritten based on the activities and risk associated with each commercial risk. This means the one-size-fits-all approach does not apply to commercial insurance. The insuring agreement is the same, and the supplemental payments are the same, but the activities of the business will determine the coverages, rates, and limits.

These coverages and rates can be affected by events far from the location of the individual insured. Disasters and catastrophes around the world have an influence on reinsurance rates, which directly affect individual rates and availability of coverage.

The form used in Canada is the Commercial General Liability (CGL) Policy (IBC 2100). This policy is 22 pages in length, and it is quite detailed and extensive. It is broad enough in scope to be able to respond to the liability exposures of individuals, corporations, general or limited partnerships, societies (such as clubs or religious groups), and government bodies. However, as with all policies, there are exclusions and the broker should do a thorough analysis of the insured to be aware of these exclusions and bring them to the attention of the insured.

Similar to habitations, businesses also have the general liability exposures based on the condition of their premises and their operations or activities. Whether the business is a retail operation (such as a hardware store catering to the public) or a manufacturing operation with no public access, there is a liability exposure. An appliance store has both on- and off-premises exposure in the showroom and the installation of appliances in customers’ homes. There is an exposure for medical payments if a visitor injures themselves on-site, just like Section F: Voluntary Medical Payments in a Homeowner Policy. A tenant in a building has a tenant’s legal liability exposure based on its care, custody, and control of the space it leases and occupies.

However, businesses do have some unique exposures that habitational policies don’t:

• Tenant’s legal liability: When a business owns a building, damage to the building would come under the building section of their property policy. When a business rents or leases a property, they have an exposure in tort law for damage to the property in their care, custody, and control. Section A of the liability policy excludes payment for damages to premises they occupy. This gap in coverage is provided by tenant’s legal liability insurance. The coverage is limited to payment for only those losses for which the tenant is legally liable in tort (negligent); liabilities assumed under contract are excluded but can be insured under a separate policy. The amount purchased should be no less than the value of the building or portion of the building occupied.

• Product liability: Generally, a product is anything sold by the insured. Consumers have the right to expect that the goods they purchase will be safe. When their use results in injury or damage, consumers have a right to take legal action against the party that made or sold the defective product. Business liability policies provide coverage for this exposure.

• Completed operations liability: When completed work is put to its intended use and injury or damage results, the party responsible for the work may be sued for damages. Appliance repair shops and plumbing, heating, and electrical contractors all have a completed operations liability exposure.

• Personal and advertising injury liability: Personal and advertising injury means injury, including consequential bodily injury, arising out of one or more of the following offences:

- Libel and slander.

- Malicious persecution.

- Wrongful entry or eviction.

- Invasion of privacy.

- False arrest.

- Detention or imprisonment.

- Unauthorized use of another’s advertising idea.

In an action alleging personal injury, the wronged party may seek damage for extreme humiliation, stress, or other personal injury.

• Hold harmless agreement: Also known as a hold harmless clause or hold harmless provision, this is a clause in a legal contract that absolves one party of legal liability for any injuries or damages suffered by another party. It plays a crucial role in a business transaction where the risk of injury is high. It is essentially a risk transfer mechanism and an indication of the extent of risk each party is prepared to assume. Careful drafting of the clause determines the extent of the protection the clause will provide the recipient of the hold harmless agreement.

For example, a homeowner having their roof repaired would have the roofer sign a hold harmless agreement to absolve the homeowners from liability if the roofer were to fall off the roof. A hold harmless clause is also printed on the back of a ski lift ticket absolving the ski operator from liability if the skier were to be injured on the hill. Commercially, a tenant may have to sign a hold harmless agreement absolving the landlord from any liability for damage if caused by the landlord. By signing or accepting the form, the signer has acknowledged the risks and agreed to accept them.

The hold harmless agreement does not always protect the person or company against a lawsuit or liability. The agreement must specifically state that the signer is waiving their rights to sue for negligence. Such agreements can be disregarded if they are vague or overly broad in language or believed to be fraudulent.

The CGL Policy also provides:

• Blanket contractual coverage for liability assumed by the insured, such as lease of premises, a side-track agreement, and other agreements.

• Contingent employer’s liability, which protects the insured for bodily injury to employees on whose behalf contributions are made by, or required to be made by, the insured under the provisions of any workers’ compensation law. If the workers’ compensation plan does not respond to a claim, the employer’s liability would respond.

• Owner’s and contractor’s protective liability, which provides the insured with coverage arising from the activities of a general contractor or sub-contractors.

These policies can also be extended by endorsement to include:

• Garage liability, which responds to the exclusion under the CGL Policy for payment for injury or damage to others arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of any automobile. This covers third-party liability for owned and non-owned vehicles and legal liability arising out of damage to customers’ automobiles while under their care, custody, and control.

• Limited environmental liability, which provides coverage for the sudden and accidental discharge, dispersal, release, or escape of pollutants. This coverage is only available on a selective basis.

• Employer’s bodily injury liability, which covers the insured with respect to claims of bodily injury to an employee not covered by workers’ compensation and arising out of and in the course of employment.

• It is important that both the broker and the insured understand the extent to which coverage is limited by Section III of the policy. Payment is based on both the Aggregate and Occurrence limit. In Personal lines there is no aggregate limit applied to the policy.

The aggregate limit stated on the policy is the most the policy will pay during the policy period for all claims for which insurance is provide28.

For example, if the policy contains a $2M aggregate limit, the insurer is not responsible for damages awarded more than that amount, whether by way of a single action or several actions, within the policy period. The policy may also state that there is a maximum payable per occurrence, say of $1M, with an aggregate of $2M. During the policy term, there are three losses; one for $1M, a second for $1.5M, and a third for $1.5M.

The first loss would be paid to the limit. The second loss would be capped at $1M, due to occurrence limit on the policy, therefore the insured would be responsible for $500,000. This second loss also breaches the $2M aggregate limit, therefore any subsequent claims, such as the third loss, would totally be the responsibility of the insured to pay.

Each of the many and varied policy wordings have definitions and exclusions particular to the them. It is important to know your client, know the company, and know the wordings!

8.9.2 Professional Liability

Although the CGL Policy is broad, it is not designed to insure the special liability needs of professionals — that’s where professional liability insurance comes in. The focus of professional liability policies is to provide payment for damages arising out of the rendering or failure to render professional services.

A professional is someone who possesses or claims to possess the special knowledge and skill necessary to render a professional service. When that knowledge or skill is deficient and financial or other injury results, a claim for damages may be initiated against the professional.

There are two major classes of professionals, including:

1) Those who administer health care, such as doctors, dentists, and pharmacists. Malpractice insurance will cover their legal liability arising out of the rendering or failure to render their professional service.

2) Those who give advice and counselling, such as lawyers, accountants, architects, and insurance and real estate brokers. Professionals having this exposure can buy errors and omissions (E&O) insurance to cover their exposure.
Occurrence-Based Policy Form 	Claims Made Policy form
The insurance company that was on the risk at the time the loss occurred will respond to the claim. 	The insurance company that is on the risk at the time the claim is made will respond.

These policies are written on a Claims Made Policy Form (IBC 2200), which is different from an Occurrence-based Policy Form (IBC 2100). The key difference between these two policies is that, under an Occurrence-based Policy, the insurance company that was on the risk at the time the loss occurred will respond to the claim. With a Claims Made Policy, the insurance company that is on the risk at the time the claim is made will respond. For many types of losses, the occurrence date may be indeterminate, but the date of the claim can be determined. For example, the exposure to asbestos may have occurred over a long period of time, making it hard to determine a fixed date of exposure; but the date of its manifestation as a cancer can be determined. These forms are highly detailed, and you’ll have to study them closely to be fully aware of the difference.

8.9.3 Commercial Umbrella Liability

In some cases, the liability policies purchased by the business may not address their complete liability insurance needs. Potential problems include:

• Inadequate limits because the primary insurer denied increased limits due to its own restrictions regarding reinsurance facilities and capacity.

• Inadequate coverage.

In these situations, providing an umbrella liability policy, as well as additional limits and broader policy coverages, can solve these problems. The umbrella policy is designed to respond only after the underlying or primary policy has responded. In the event of inadequate coverage under the primary policy, the insured must pay a deductible or self-insured retention (SIR) for additional coverage. This encourages the insured to buy adequate insurance for obvious liability exposure on the primary policy.

The application for umbrella liability coverage is quite extensive due to the nature of the policy. Furthermore, coverage cannot be bound by the broker — the policy comes into effect only after acceptance by the insurer. It’s also important to note that understanding the exclusions under an umbrella policy is just as important as understanding the exclusions under a primary policy.

8.10 CONCLUSION

This concludes our look at liability insurance, which is a mix of both legal history and specific policy wordings from the Homeowner Policy, Section II: Liability Coverages. You might be surprised at the broad range of risks that insureds can be liable for! This is a key area of insurance that will take time to fully comprehend but also to effectively apply. We recommend working with a mentor and asking questions of both your principal broker, your clients, and your underwriters to help you properly protect your clients and what they do.

9.1 INTRODUCTION

Automobile insurance in Ontario is a universal coverage that is both simple and complex.

It’s simple because the provincial government regulates what the drivers are required to have in their policies and the associated coverages. This creates consistency between all insurers’ products, and helps the consumer know what to expect at the time of a claim.

It’s complex because the provincial government included policy conditions to help clarify who is responsible at the time of a claim, but, in turn, also imposed strict guidelines in how insurers can administer their policies to adapt to a changing market.

One fact for any insurance broker is this: you will be dealing with a lot of automobile clients. How this policy was created — and how it links to government regulations — will be a necessary piece of knowledge when you discuss coverages with your clients.

This chapter consists of three parts:

1) Part 1: Background of Automobile Insurance.

2) Part 2: The Owner’s Policy (OAP 1).

3) Part 3: Facility Association, the Role of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario, and Standard Policy Forms.

Throughout this chapter, we’ve included excerpts from the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1) wording to highlight key areas in the policy that you should know. We’ve also included a very important section immediately following Part 2, called Section 9.3.10: Ontario Policy Change Forms. This section lists and describes the major forms used to make changes, or endorsements, to the OAP 1. The OAF is not included with this textbook as it changes from time to time.

9.2.1 Introduction

Automobile accidents often result in injury, death, and loss to property. These losses amount to billions of dollars each year. Automobile owners need to protect themselves against the financial consequences of automobile accidents.

An automobile insurance policy can be purchased to provide coverage for:

• Third-party liability.

• Personal injury without regard to fault (accident benefits).

• Loss of or damage to the insured automobile.

9.2.2 Different Insurers across Canada

Automobile insurance is not the same in all provinces. In different provinces, automobile insurance is provided by private insurers, compulsory government insurance plans, and pure nofault and threshold no-fault insurance plans. We’ll look at the details of each of these insurers.

9.2.2.1 Private Insurers

Motorists in Alberta, Ontario, and the Atlantic provinces insure their automobiles with private insurers. In the majority of these provinces, coverage is provided by the Standard Policy Form (SPF) No. 1: Standard Automobile Policy (Owner’s Form), which was developed by the insurance industry for automobile owners. In the province of Ontario, the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1) is used to cover automobiles.

Insureds can use several standard endorsement forms (SEFs) to modify the coverages provided by this policy. In Ontario, the endorsements are available under the Ontario Policy Change Forms (OPCFs).

9.2.2.2 Compulsory Government Insurance Plans

The governments of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have established compulsory government insurance plans for all motorists residing in those provinces. The coverages are different for each province, as shown in the graph below.
Province 	Third-party liability 	Accident benefits 	Physical damage
British Columbia 	$200,000 	Included 	Optional
Saskatchewan 	$200,000 	Included 	$500 deductible
Manitoba 	$200,000 	Included 	$400 deductible

All automobile owners are automatically entitled to purchase insurance equivalent to the minimum compulsory limits established by law. For this reason, provinces having compulsory government automobile insurance plans do not operate under the Facility Association. (Refer to Section 9.4.1 for more about the Facility Association.)

Private insurers compete with government insurance plans in these provinces for excess coverages only. These include:

• Increased third-party liability limits.

• Addition of physical damage coverages (British Columbia).

• Reduction of physical damage deductible (Saskatchewan and Manitoba).

When sold by private insurers, excess coverages are issued on a separate policy. Changes to these policies are generally made on the SEFs.

In Quebec, the government maintains a monopoly on personal injury coverages for accidents occurring in that province. Other coverages may be purchased from private insurers.

9.2.2.3 Pure No-Fault and Threshold No-Fault Insurance Plans

Some provinces have implemented “no-fault” automobile insurance plans. While these plans are not all the same, their primary purpose is to provide benefits to persons injured in automobile accidents, regardless of who is at fault.

A pure no-fault plan removes the right of legal action against drivers who cause injury or death to others. Instead, all accident victims (or their legal representatives) may claim compensation from their own insurers. This plan is used in Manitoba and Quebec.

A threshold no-fault plan is used in Ontario. Under this plan, legal action against the responsible party is not permitted unless a certain threshold is exceeded. The threshold requires two conditions that must be met for legal action against the negligent owner/driver (we’ll discuss these later in the chapter, in Section 9.3.6: Fault Determination Rules).

9.2.2.4 Facility Association

Insurance coverage must be available for every licensed driver. However, when an applicant fails to meet the underwriting standards established by the insurer (that is, if their record is not a risk an insurer wants to add to their book), coverage may be denied.
Has Facility Association 	Does Not Have Facility Association
Alberta 	British Columbia
New Brunswick 	Manitoba
Newfoundland & Labrador 	Saskatchewan
Northwest Territories 	Quebec
Nova Scotia 	
Nunavut 	
Ontario 	
Prince Edward Island 	
Yukon 	

Each of the provinces that participates in the Facility Association to ensure the availability of coverage for applicants who are refused insurance, also known as a pool. All insurers writing automobile liability insurance are members and share in the pooled results. When persons insured are unable to qualify for coverage in the marketplace, they are removed from the pool. We’ll learn more about the Facility Association in Section 9.4.1.

9.2.3 Ontario Application for Automobile Insurance: Owner’s Form (OAF 1)

The information necessary to properly underwrite, rate, and issue an automobile insurance policy is taken from a completed and signed application form. In Ontario, this form is the Ontario Application for Automobile Insurance: Owner’s Form (OAF 1).

To understand how the policy functions, let’s look at what it is asking the applicants. The insurer requires that all questions contained in the application be answered fully. More than one automobile can be insured by the same policy. Also, as this application is used to insure both private passenger and commercial automobiles, it contains questions specific to both uses. For commercially rated vehicles, the applicant must complete a separate commercial/public automobile supplement.

The OAF is not included with this textbook as it changes from time to time. To get the most current version of the OAF 1, go to this link and download the PDF form.

https://www.fsrao.ca/oaf-1-ontario-application-automobile-insurance-owners-form

9.2.3.1 Section 1: Name and Postal Address

The information in Section 1: Name and Postal Address is important for various reasons.

Before agreeing to provide the applicant with insurance, the insurer will request a driver history (also known as a “driver abstract”) from the provincial licensing body. Errors in providing the driver abstract are less likely to occur when the full name and address of the applicant are provided to the insurer.

The territory in which the automobile will be used has a bearing on the potential for loss. The insurer anticipates that the described automobile is in, and will be chiefly used in, the vicinity of the applicant’s address. If that assumption is incorrect, the applicant must provide all details. The application also requires that both the applicant’s residence and business telephone numbers be stated.

If the automobile being insured is leased, the lessor’s full name and postal address must be provided.

9.2.3.2 Section 2: Policy Period

The coverage begins at the time the application is taken and expires at 12:01 a.m. the local time at the address of the insured. This time and location is important because Ontario has different time zones. If an accident happens at 12:01 a.m. in Ottawa and another one happens simultaneously in Kenora, Kenora’s time of accident will be 11:01 p.m. This critical time difference means one automobile policy just expired, whereas the other has not.

Policies are normally issued for 12 months, meaning they need to be renewed yearly.

9.2.3.3 Section 3: Details of the Described Automobile

In the event of a claim, the insurer will want to be certain that the automobile for which coverage is being claimed is insured under the policy. When completing Section 3: Details of the Described Automobile, the applicant must provide the vehicle’s model, year, make or trade name, body type, cylinders or displacement, gross vehicle weight, and vehicle identification number (VIN). They must also disclose whether the vehicle is owned or leased, when it was purchased or leased, and the purchase price, including options and taxes. Other questions pertain to use of the vehicle: commuting distance to work (one way), annual driving distances, details of any carpooling, type of fuel (gas or diesel), and disclosure of any unrepaired damages. Any modifications — such as non-factory wheels, electronic equipment, or fancy paint alterations — must be added to the Remarks section. In the OAF 1, page 2, Special Note 1 specifies a $1,500 limit on after-factory installed electronic accessories and equipment in the vehicle.

The applicant must also provide the name and address of any lienholder and a declaration as to the applicant being the registered owner and the actual owner. A copy of the vehicle registration identifies the owner of the vehicle, and the policy must be in the name registered with the Ministry of Transportation.

The policy contains exclusions for certain uses of the vehicle. The applicant must indicate if the vehicle is being rented or leased, carrying passengers for compensation or hire, hauling a trailer, or carrying explosives or radioactive materials. If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” the applicant may require additional coverage by endorsement.

The final question asks for the total number of automobiles in the household. This includes vehicles belonging to other household members (for example, vehicles belonging to the applicant’s children or company-supplied vehicles). Note that if any of these vehicles are already insured on another policy, they would not be included in this application. This question allows the underwriter to check the history of these drivers; if their history is found to be not satisfactory, the underwriter may want to exclude them from the applicant’s policy.

This information is also important for rating purposes when physical damage coverages are required. Insurers maintain information on the costs to repair or replace various makes and models of automobiles. Generally, repair costs increase as the value of the automobile increases. This means that insureds having expensive automobiles will pay a higher premium for physical damage coverages than owners of lesser-value automobiles. Some insurers also charge more for insuring certain types of highpowered or customized cars.

In a recent trend, automobile manufacturers have added more sophisticated equipment into previously hollow parts, like bumpers or side mirrors. Now, they have cameras, proximity sensors, or accelerometers, making these once cheap replacement parts much more expensive. Sometimes it’s not just the brand name that makes a vehicle expensive — it’s the parts that go into it.

To assist the insurer in the settlement of future claims, the applicant is also required to provide the following information:

• If leased by the applicant: name and address of the lessor.

• If purchased by the applicant: new or used, date, and value (including equipment).

• Name and address of any lienholder or mortgagee.

When others have a financial interest in the automobile being insured (such as a mortgagee), their interest is recorded and protected in the event of a loss.

9.2.3.4 Section 4: Driver Information

Automobile insurance policies permit the use of the automobile by persons not named on the policy. Section 4: Driver Information is designed to identify anyone who will regularly or occasionally use the insured automobile.

The applicant is required to provide the following information:

• Names of all drivers (as shown on their driver’s licenses).

• Approximate percentage of their use of the automobile.

• Number of years licensed.

If drivers have graduated from a driver training course, a copy of that certificate should be included with the application. If there are other licensed drivers in the household, they must also be listed in the Remarks section.

The OAF 1 also asks whether any of the drivers qualify for a retiree discount. Special Note 2: Retiree Discount explains the qualification requirements to obtain this discount. The discount applies if the principal operator:

• Is retired.

• Is age 65 or older or receiving a pension.

• Has no earned income.

• Is not working.

• Has not been employed for the last 26 weeks in the last 52 weeks.

• Is not operating a business.

It also indicates that, if the applicant qualifies, they must sign a declaration that they are a retiree.

Near the end of this section, the applicant must provide information about their most recent insurer, including the policy number and expiry date.

Further questions ask whether the applicant knows of:

• Any suspensions or cancellations of the driver’s licenses of any listed driver within the last six years.

• Any cancellation of insurance within the last three years for the applicant or any listed driver.

• Any claim denied for material misrepresentation within the past three years for the applicant or any listed driver.

• Any fraud connected with automobile insurance by the applicant or any listed driver. (There is no time restraint on this question.)

If the answer to any of the above questions is “yes”, the applicant must provide details in the Remarks section.

9.2.3.5 Section 5: Previous Accidents and Insurance Claims

In Section 5: Previous Accidents and Insurance Claims, the applicant must provide details of any and all previous accidents and claims for the last six years. This information applies to all owned vehicles, or use or operation of any automobile, including where they were listed as a driver. Any accidents that occurred while the applicant was driving a non-owned automobile (such as an employer’s) must also be disclosed.

The previous accident and claim information must include the following, to the best of the applicant’s knowledge: drivers, vehicles, dates, types of claim, and amounts paid.

9.2.3.6 Section 6: History of Convictions

The insurer will carefully screen all applicants to ensure that insurance is not provided to anyone who has an undesirable driver history. They will check the applicant’s convictions history from the previous three years, including offences for impaired driving, speeding, and failure to yield the right of way. Even though offences may not have resulted in an accident, they may point to poor driving habits or a disregard for the law.

Section 6: History of Convictions requires the date and description of each conviction.

9.2.3.7 Section 7: Rating Information

Section 7: Rating Information is for the insurance broker or company to develop the rating information based on all the previous sections of the application. It will indicate:

• The driving class.

• Driving record for each section of the policy.

• Claim or conviction surcharges.

• Vehicle price or code.

• Applicable rate groups for accident benefits.

• Direct compensation and physical damage.

• Location and territory.

• Any discounts that may apply.

This section will determine the premium to be charged for the coverages selected in Section 8: Insurance Coverages Applied For.

9.2.3.8 Section 8: Insurance Coverages Applied For

Section 8: Insurance Coverages Applied For allows the applicant to select the coverages required, including any optional increased accident benefits or endorsements. They may also select limits and deductibles.

A total premium is shown per vehicle; however, the applicant needs to be informed that the policy premium shown is an estimated premium and subject to adjustment or confirmation by the insurer. The applicant also needs to be informed that there will be a minimum premium charge if the applicant cancels their policy.

9.2.3.9 Section 9: Remarks

Section 9: Remarks allows the applicant to provide further details for any of the above application sections.

9.2.3.10 Section 10: Method of Payment

Section 10: Method of Payment identifies the type of payment plan, estimated policy premium, tax, interest, and total estimated cost. Separate boxes are for amount paid, balance owing, number of remaining installments, amount of each installment, and due date.

9.2.3.11 Section 11: Declaration of Applicant

Section 11: Declaration of Applicant is where the applicant signs to attest that they understand the purpose and factual accuracy of the information they have provided, including that the drivers:

• Must not suffer from mental or health-related disabilities that will interfere with the ability to drive safely.

• Must not be addicted to alcohol or drugs to the extent that it will interfere with their ability to drive safely.

• Must notify the Ministry of Transportation if they become physically or emotionally disabled to the extent that it will interfere with their ability to drive safely.

The applicant warrants that all drivers are qualified to hold a driver’s license and that all completed sections of the application are correct. Warning is given for false statements, misrepresentations, and fraud.

The Insurance Act requires that the insured be given clear warning of the consequences for making a false statement on the application for insurance and any subsequent claim brought under the policy. Generally, the right to recover under the policy is forfeited when the insured:

• Provides a false description of the automobile being insured which is to the prejudice of the insurer. For example, manufacturers normally make two or more models of the same automobile. When the difference between them is substantial, the premium required to insure them may vary significantly. When an applicant seeking a lower premium describes the automobile as being of a lesser model than it actually is, such description prejudices the position of the insurer.

• Knowingly misrepresents the risk or fails to disclose a required fact. Misrepresentation can often be traced to the applicant’s statements regarding previous accidents, refusals of insurance, or the intended use of the vehicle.

• Breaches a policy term. The most common contraventions are usually of those set out in the Statutory Conditions.

• Commits a fraud. Fraud is committed, for example, when insureds attempt to claim for loss or damage to the automobile which was deliberately caused by them.

• Willfully makes a false statement in respect of a claim. The word “willfully” suggests that the insured intends to deceive the insurer into paying for a claim which is not insured by the policy. False statements typically concern the consumption of alcohol, the amount of the loss, the identity of the driver, and consent to use the automobile.

The applicant warrants the truth of all statements made in the application for insurance and further agrees to permit the insurer to obtain, from any source, reports containing personal, credit, factual, investigative, or driver record information in connection with the application, renewal, extension, or variation thereof.

When insurers need to verify the truth of the information contained in the application, they rely on two common sources: (1) Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation or such other provincial registry having jurisdiction and (2) the applicant’s previous insurer, the name of which must be disclosed in the application, if applicable.

9.2.3.12 Section 12: Report of Broker/Agent

Section 12: Report of Broker/Agent is completed by the broker/agent and indicates:

• If the coverage has been bound.

• If the business is new to the broker.

• The type of liability card issued (for example, temporary or permanent).

• If the applicant is known to the broker.

• How long the broker has known the principal driver.

9.2.4 Take All Comers Rule

As we have read earlier, the Insurance Act in Ontario makes automobile insurance mandatory in the province for any driver on the road. As such, there has also been some consumer protection built onto the legislation, ensuring that all consumers are able receive a quotation for automobile insurance, at a fair price according to the rates and regulations filed by auto insurers with FSRA, to help enforce this law. The Ontario law prohibits insurers from denying a basic auto policy to anyone, except on grounds filed with the regulator. This law is known as the “take all comers rule” (TAC). Any insurer caught failing to comply with this legislation can face a varying range and degree of punishments from FSRA.

For brokers, however, it is their responsibility to provide the best possible coverage at the lowest possible price that meets the client’s needs. To do that, a broker must go to all available insurers their brokerage has to seek auto quotes for their customers. If an insurer fails to provide a quotation on an application for a client, it is then up to the broker to inform the customer of this act of the insurer, and also to document the situation accordingly. Whenever this situation is encountered, it is important for a broker to have thorough documentation and be able to explain the situation with their customer.

Let’s look at two brief examples;

Jarrod has had three claims in one year, and his policy is up for renewal. All of the claims were not-at-fault claims. Jarrod’s insurance company, however, responds to the renewal that may be a higher risk for future claims and refuses to offer a renewal on that reason. However, the insurer did not file that specific underwriting rule with FSRA. The insurer is therefore in violation of the TAC rule.

Myriam, a broker, enters a prospect’s auto application into the brokerage’s quoting system, but only four of their six markets provided her a quote. The client has a clean driving history. Recognizing the issue here, Myriam decides to verify why those two markets did not quote and also checks where she can try to obtain a quote from in another way. Myriam took detailed notes. Only after doing this work did Myriam contact her prospect and present all options to them, with explanations.

9.2.5 Approved Applications

The Insurance Act states that the submitted application must form an actual part of the whole contract. OAP 1, Section 1.1 states that

“The contract includes three documents:

• A completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance,

• A Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and

• This policy.”

When the application is acceptable to the insurer, the underwriter will issue the policy. For this reason, it is essential that all questions be answered fully and honestly.

Upon approval, the insurer will issue a Certificate of Automobile Insurance to the applicant. The certificate will include the information from the application, as well as the limits, deductibles, term of coverage, endorsements, and premium.

The front of the application has a brief explanation of the coverage sections. However, the coverage may not be the same as what was applied for, because the coverage is subject to decisions made by the insurer at the underwriting stage. Some common differences may be higher deductibles or additional restricting endorsements.

The certificate will indicate that the client can obtain a copy of the complete OAP 1 policy if requested. However, very few requests for complete policy wordings are ever made, so the Certificate of Automobile Insurance is the confirmation of coverage to the client.

9.2.6 Policy Renewals

When a policy is renewed, the insurer will issue a new Certificate of Automobile Insurance which indicates the new inception and expiration dates. If the insurer changes any other terms, the policy is deemed to be offered on a varied terms basis.

Additionally, if there are varied terms (for example, deductible limits are higher), the Ontario Insurance Act requires that the insurer give notice to the broker not less than 45 days prior to the renewal of such varied terms. The broker must similarly give notice to the client not less than 30 days before the renewal date. If the broker does not give the 30 days’ notice, the broker could be held responsible for the difference in the varied terms. In order to prevent errors and omissions (E&O) claims against the broker and/or the brokerage, brokers need to advise clients immediately when an insurer wishes to renew a policy on varied terms.

If an insurer does not wish to offer a renewal, this will also constitute a varied term. In these situations, the broker must either (1) replace the policy with an alternate insurer or (2) advise the client of the insurer’s position at least 30 days before the renewal date. Failing to advise the client within this time could make the broker responsible for the claim.

Effective since 1990, the Certificate of Automobile Insurance must disclose to the client how their policy is rated. However, it is not good enough to show a rate class 02 or 03 because this has little meaning to the general public — instead, the certificate must show an explanation of the rate class in plain language. This allows the insured to make an intelligent comparison of coverages and the criteria. This rate class disclosure includes chargeable claims, discounts that may be available, class description (02, 03, 07, etc.), driving record description, and surcharges.

9.3.1 Introduction to the OAP 1

In this section, we’ll examine all the component parts of the Ontario Automobile Policy: Owner’s Policy (OAP 1). Learning this content will help you during your exam (because knowing which sections contain specific information will help you quickly find the answers) and help you explain to your clients how their policies will work for them. Although the OAP 1 refers to coverages and amounts, it does not contain the schedule of those amounts, because the schedule is adjusted from time to time. You can find a summary of this schedule on IBAO’s website on Ontario Auto for reference,

https://www.ibao.org/materials/ontario-auto/

9.3.2 Plain Language Wordings

Ontario was the first province to approve a plain language automobile policy. “Plain language” means that the legal and insurance jargon and technical conditions found in old policies would be “translated” so that the general public could understand them.

The OAP 1 came into effect March 31, 1994. The policy has changed over time, but the most current version was approved for use on September 1, 2010 by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (the predecessor to the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario).

Using plain language wording helps average Ontario residents to easily understand their coverage on their own. In addition to the then-new policy format, new endorsement forms in Ontario were also written in plain language.

9.3.3 Mandatory Coverages

To ensure that no one being insured to drive in Ontario is left without necessary coverages, the Ontario government established a set of directives for the automobile insurance industry to bring in standardized, or mandatory, coverages.

On November 1, 1996, the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability Act, 1996 became law. This act set the minimum standard for all automobile insurance policy coverages in Ontario. One of the government’s main goals was to deter people from intentionally driving without insurance; as a result, the fine for this offence was increased to $5,000, up to a maximum of $25,000 for the first offence, and from $10,000 to a maximum of $50,000 for the second offence.

The act also set other basic ground rules and mandatory coverages for all licensed drivers in Ontario. Here’s an overview of these mandatory coverages — we’ll explore them in much greater detail later in the chapter.

9.3.3.1 Section 3: Liability Coverage

Since March 1, 1981, the minimum liability coverage in Section 3: Liability Coverage has been set to $200,000 for property damage and bodily injury, combined. If a claim reaches or exceeds this limit, then injury claims take priority, and the amount is apportioned as follows:

• $190,000 for bodily injury.

• $10,000 for property damage.

9.3.3.2 Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage

The accident benefits under Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage are often referred to as “nofault benefits” and are set out in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule (SABS). (The SABS can be found in Regulation 403/96 of the Insurance Act.) Although these are mandatory, the insured also has the option of purchasing additional accident benefits to supplement the basic mandatory benefits. The SABS includes:

• Income replacement benefit.

• Non-earner benefit.

• Caregiver benefit.

• Dependant care benefit.

• Medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits.

• Payment of other expenses.

• Death and funeral benefits.

• Optional benefits (for example, increased limits for the above benefits, indexation of benefits payable, etc.).

9.3.3.3 Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage

Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage provides protection for the insured, their spouses, and their children, as well as the operators of the described automobile, if they are struck and injured by an uninsured automobile.

9.3.3.4 Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage Coverage

Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage Coverage, known as DCPD, responds when there is damage to the insured’s automobile, its contents, or its loss of use due to an accident in Ontario that is not the insured’s fault.

On January 1, 2024, the Ontario Government made its first change to the OAP 1 by creating an opt-out option for consumers from the DCPD mandatory coverage. Known as OPCF 49: Agreement Not to Recover for Loss or Damage from an Automobile Collision, this endorsement permits the policyholder to not have DCPD on their policy if they are the legal owner of the vehicle (i.e. in other words, they are not leasing the vehicle). This change form also makes cascading changes to Section 7: Optional Coverages, specifically to collision and the comprehensive coverages, as those sections rely on DCPD being in place.

9.3.4 Optional Coverages

When we describe some coverages as “optional,” we do not mean they are “add-ons” or less necessary than the mandatory coverages — rather, these coverages extend the mandatory coverages into key areas that drivers will benefit from.

Optional coverages include the following:

• Increased liability limits: The minimum limits in Ontario are $200,000, but most policies are issued with higher limits, such as $1,000,000 or higher.

• Physical damage (loss or damage) coverages: These coverages are designed to indemnify policyholders for physical damage to their automobile. They may be called “all perils,” “collision,” “comprehensive,” or “specified perils” coverage. Each of them covers damage to the vehicle itself, as well as coverage for damage caused by different perils. A deductible (in variable amounts) always applies, unless the loss is caused by fire or lightning.

• Optional accident benefits coverages: Insureds can increase the coverage limits specified in the SABS to allow for better than standard coverage. We’ll discuss these limits, as well as the optional increases, in more detail in Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverages.

• Other coverage and/or policy changes: Optional coverage is provided through endorsements known as the Ontario Policy Change Forms (OPCFs). These forms are used to indicate changes to the basic provisions of the policy. Later in the chapter, we’ll look at the most common endorsements (Section 9.3.10: Ontario Policy Change Forms).

9.3.5 Notice of Accident

An insured person is required to report an accident to their automobile insurer within seven days of an accident if:

• The accident has been reported to the police under the Highway Traffic Act (for example, for injury, criminal acts, damage over $2000, etc.); or

• The accident will be reported to an agent or broker, regardless of who is at fault.

If the insured is unable to report the accident due to incapacity, they may comply with this condition by reporting the accident as soon as they regain the ability to do so. If a third party has a right of recovery against the policy, then that party may make the claim on their own behalf, as stated in the Statutory Conditions.

9.3.6 Fault Determination Rules

The Fault Determination Rules (which can be found in the Insurance Act, Regulation 668) contain examples of common types of collisions. The rules also describe how fault is assigned for insurance purposes — for example, by using the Fault Chart. The Fault Chart covers the most common types of accidents and includes diagrams illustrating the points of impact between two or more cars. The diagrams illustrate how to apportion fault between the vehicles. The Fault Chart rules are based on the rules of the road and tort law precedents set in past cases.

Let’s look at these examples.

If an insured disagrees with the liability derived from the Fault Determination Rules, they have the option of taking legal action against the insurer. If an insured disagrees with the amount of a settlement offered for damage to the vehicle, they can refer to OAP 1, Section 6.7.3: Settling a Claim and ask for an appraisal. In these situations, the insured and the insurer will each appoint an appraiser who will either agree on an amount or will appoint an umpire to decide between their respective positions.

9.3.7 Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card

Like other Canadian jurisdictions, Ontario requires proof of financial responsibility. As of March 1994, the Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card, commonly referred to as the “pink slip,” was introduced to Ontarians. This certificate clearly indicates coverage is provided within Canada and the United States.

9.3.8 Sections of the OAP 1

We’ll now take an in-depth look at the most important parts of the OAP 1. It’s important to learn the OAP 1 in its entirety. However, we’ll expand on some specific sections in the pages that follow. You’ll want to keep your copy handy as you review these sections!

9.3.8.1 Section 1: Introduction

Section 1: Introduction provides definitions of terms and explains information that applies to the entire policy. For example, it includes:

• Where the insured is covered.

• How to cancel the policy.

• Who and what the insurance company will not cover.

• Where to make a claim and who may make it.

9.3.8.1.1 Section 1.1: This Policy is Part of a Contract

“This policy is part of a contract between you and us. The contract includes three documents:

• A completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance,

• A Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and

• This policy.”

9.3.8.1.2 Section 1.2: Where You Are Covered (Territory)

“This policy covers you and other insured persons for incidents occurring in Canada, the United States of America and any other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, and on a vessel travelling between ports of those countries.

All of the dollar limits described in this policy are in Canadian funds.”

9.3.8.1.3 Section 1.3: Definitions

Under the OAP 1, the definition of an automobile includes the “described automobile” — that is, the automobile insured under the contract and described by its year, make, model, and serial number within the policy. But it can also mean a “newly acquired automobile,” “temporary substitute automobile,” or an all-encompassing “other automobile.” Each automobile defined is covered by the policy to varying degrees. The definition of an automobile under the OAP 1 also includes motorized snow vehicles, such as snowmobiles.

The policy defines an “excluded driver” as someone specifically not covered by the policy. The names of excluded drivers are always endorsed onto the policy using OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver Endorsement. This endorsement restricts all coverages (other than certain accident benefits coverages) if the excluded driver drives the described, newly acquired, temporary substitute, or other automobile as defined in the policy.

Note that the definition of “insured person” can change from one section to another. For example, in Section 1.3: Definitions, “named insured” is defined as “the person or organization to whom the Certificate of Automobile Insurance is issued.” However, persons covered under Section 3: Liability Coverage are “you [named insured], or anyone else in possession of the automobile with your consent, [who] uses or operates it.” Meanwhile, under Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage, insured persons “are defined in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule. In addition, insured persons also include any person who is injured or killed in an automobile accident involving the automobile and is not the named insured, or the spouse or dependant of a named insured, under any other motor vehicle liability policy, and is not covered under the policy of an automobile in which they were an occupant or which struck them.”

9.3.8.1.4 Section 1.4: Your Responsibilities

The policy states that, by accepting the OAP 1 contract, the insured agrees to the conditions listed in this section. It also states that if the insured fails to meet any of the listed conditions, then claims under the policy will be denied (with the exception of certain accident benefits). Let’s look at some of the key responsibilities.

9.3.8.1.4.1 Section 1.4.1

“You agree to notify us promptly and in writing of any significant change of which you are aware in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of a described automobile. [ . . . ] You must promptly tell us of any change in information supplied in your original application for insurance, such as additional drivers, or a change in the way a described automobile is used.”

This condition is derived from Section 8: Statutory Conditions of the policy. It reinforces the importance of keeping the details of the insurance contract accurate and up to date. Even small details — like the distance the vehicle is used to commute to work — need to be updated if, for example, the insured’s job changes.

All questions asked on an application are used for rating the policy; that is, they are all factors used in determining the premium to be charged. A short, two-kilometre drive to work will usually result in a lower premium than a 24-kilometre drive to work.

9.3.8.1.4.2 Section 1.4.5

“You agree not to drive or operate the automobile or allow anyone else to drive or operate the automobile, when not authorized by law.”

Conditions 1.4.5 and 1.4.6 are very important conditions within the contract. Collectively, they maintain coverage under the contract only when the vehicle is being used lawfully. Examples of people not authorized by law to drive include unlicensed drivers, those whose license is under suspension, and minors.

9.3.8.1.4.3 Section 1.4.6

“You agree not to use or allow anyone to use the automobile in a race or speed test or for any illegal trade or transportation.”

Using the vehicle in a race or speed test places both the vehicle and the passengers at greater risk of an accident than would normally be expected. This type of increased risk is not considered when calculating the premium for the policy.

As mentioned, the policy states that if the insured fails to meet any of the responsibilities in this section, claims under the policy (with the exception of certain accident benefits) will be denied. Correspondingly, this means that certain accident benefits will still be payable regardless of any breach of these conditions. For example, an excluded driver operating the vehicle will still qualify for the medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits if they are injured in an accident. (We’ll cover accident benefits in detail later in this chapter, in Section 9.3.8.4: Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.)

9.3.8.1.5 Section 1.6: Our Rights and Responsibilities

The three subsections that follow are each, in some way, related to the settlement of any dispute over money. Claims, premium payments, and premium over- and underpayments are all addressed here.

9.3.8.1.5.1 Section 1.6.1: Payment of Claims

“We will pay legitimate claims within 60 days of receiving a proof of loss. Some claims for Accident Benefits will be paid sooner. If we refuse to pay a claim, we will notify the insured person in writing explaining the reasons why we are not liable to pay.”

The policy refers here to a proof of loss. A proof of loss is a formal statement made by the insured to the insurer regarding a claim, giving details of the loss so the insurer can determine the extent of its liability.

After an accident, an insurance company will usually send the insured a proof of loss form to complete. It is essentially a blank piece of paper, and the insured is required to write an explanation of the events which led up to the accident, such as:

• The parties involved.

• Any witnesses who were present.

• The degree of damages.

• The amount claimed and any other insurable interest of others or incumbrances.

• All other pertinent details about the loss and the resulting claim.

Note that the policy states that legitimate claims will be paid within 60 days of the insurer receiving the proof of loss — not 60 days from the date of the accident.

Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage is designed to help the insured pay for any medical services they require. Since medical attention is often required immediately following an accident, certain components of Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage will be paid sooner than the prescribed 60 days.

9.3.8.1.5.2 Section 1.6.2: If You Have Been Incorrectly Classified and Your Premium is Wrong

“If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too high a premium, we will refund any premium overpayment with interest.

[ . . . ]

If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too low a premium, we will require you to pay an additional premium as long as we tell you within 60 days of the effective date of the policy. We will not charge you interest on the additional premium.”

Incorrect classifications occasionally happen. If an application is incorrectly read by an underwriter and a policy is issued based upon the error, the premium charged will most likely be incorrect. An error of this sort will not go against the insured. This section addresses both overpayment and underpayment situations. Notice the 60-day reclassification window available to the insurer.

If the insurer does not notice the underpayment within this time period, it must honour the premium quoted until the renewal of the policy. However, an overpayment by the insured is not subject to any such timeline. Overpayment, to the knowledge of the insurer, must always be refunded, regardless of when it occurred.

Note: An incorrect classification due to the omission or the misrepresentation of a material fact on an application is not subject to the same 60-day rule. If an applicant knowingly misrepresents facts to the prejudice of the insurer, the insurer may reclassify the risk at any point upon discovering the misrepresentation.

9.3.8.1.5.3 Section 1.6.3: Monthly Premium Payment Option

Section 1.6.3: Monthly Premium Payment Option allows the insurer to add an interest charge to the premium payable. This is only if the insured chooses to pay the premium over a 12-month period instead of a total payment upfront for the coverage period.

9.3.8.1.6 Section 1.7: Cancelling Your Insurance

As we learned earlier, the OAP 1 is written in plain language, and Section 1.7: Cancelling Your Insurance is a plain language restatement of Statutory Condition 11: Termination. This section explains the differences between an insurer’s cancellation and an insured’s cancellation of the policy.

Section 1.7.1: When You Cancel explains what happens when an insured cancels the policy. An insured can cancel their policy at any time. A refund, if any, is generated by calculating the portion of premium collected which is so far unused and subtracting an administrative charge from that amount. This is commonly referred to as a “short rate” refund. The unearned premium is returned to the insured, less the deducted fee.

Section 1.7.2: When We Cancel explains what happens when an insurer cancels the policy. An insurer can cancel the policy for any of the reasons listed in the wording under this section. This section mentions “reason[s] [ . . . ] filed with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority”; this refers to a process where every insurer files their own cancellation reasons with the FSRA. Every insurance company designs its own guidelines for risks it will accept and risks it deems to be outside its target market segment. Among other things, these rules include how many accidents and/or driving convictions (speeding tickets, etc.) a person can have before the company considers the risk too high to accept. These guidelines are then submitted to the FSRA for approval. If the FSRA decides the submissions are fair, the company is allowed to use the guidelines as its “declination rules” — that is, their reasons to decline a risk. If a policy is issued by a broker and it is later discovered that a driver listed on the automobile policy has more convictions than the company’s filed regulations allow, the company can cancel the policy within 60 days of its issuance. Any refund issued after an insurer has cancelled the policy will consist of the complete unearned premium collected (no administration charge is deducted). This is known as a “pro rata” or “proportionate basis” refund.

If there is a minimum retained premium stated in the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, that amount will not be refunded in either the short rate or the pro rata cancellation process.

Section 1.7.3: How We Can Cancel for Non-payment of Premium refers to the first two strikes of the so-called “three strikes” cancellation for non-payment process. If an insured is cancelled for nonpayment of premiums, the notification of cancellation must provide:

• 30 days’ notice, if sent by registered mail.

• 10 days’ notice, if hand delivered.

This notice must state the amount owed to the insurer at the time the notice is sent. The mailing or delivering of this notification meets the legal requirement for the insurer to provide “notice” — however, the 30- or 10-day notification period begins on the second day after the notice has been mailed (i.e. if the notice was mailed on a Monday, the notice begins on the Wednesday). The insured now has the option of allowing the policy to cancel on the stated date, or pay the amount stated on the notification which is owed to the insurer before noon of the business day prior to the stated cancellation date. If the insured pays the owed amount by that time, the cancellation procedure is stopped, and the policy remains in force as though no cancellation notice had been sent.

If the insured misses another payment and the insurer initiates the cancellation procedure for the second time, the same conditions would apply.

However, upon the third cancellation for non-payment, the cancellation notice becomes the same as a cancellation for any other reason, as explained in Section 1.7.4: How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons. The required notice period is 15 days from the day following the day of the notification mailing, or five days if personally hand delivered. The insurer is under no obligation to reinstate the policy — even if the amount owing is paid before the cancellation date. The two previous notification periods would have stated the amount owed at the time the notice was mailed or personally delivered; however, on the third notice, the amount stated is the amount owed to insure the policyholder until the stipulated cancellation date.

It is important to note the cancellation procedure resets itself upon each policy renewal. There must be three non-payments in a policy term before the cancellation can be delivered as described in Section 1.7.4: How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons.

9.3.8.1.6.1 Section 1.7.1: When You Cancel

“You may cancel your insurance at any time by advising us.

If you cancel, we will calculate the premium you owe on a short rate basis. Short rate means that the premium you owe will include our handling costs. We will refund anything due to you as soon as possible.

There may be a minimum premium set out in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.”

9.3.8.1.6.2 Section 1.7.2: When We Cancel

“Where your policy has been in effect for less than 60 days, we may only cancel your policy for a reason that we have filed with Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Where your policy has been in effect for more than 60 days, we may only cancel your policy for one of the following reasons:

• Non-payment of premium,

• You have given false particulars of the automobile to our prejudice,

• You have knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose information that you were required to provide in the application for automobile insurance, or

• The risk has changed materially.

If we cancel your policy, we will calculate the premium you owe on a proportionate basis. Proportionate means you will pay for the actual number of days you were covered. For example, if half the premium period is over, you will pay half the premium.

There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.

If you have paid more than the premium you owe, we will refund the difference on cancellation. Your refund may be delayed if the amount of premium you owe is subject to adjustment, or we are waiting for reports in order to determine the premium paid or owing. We will make the refund as soon as possible in that case.”

9.3.8.1.6.3 Section 1.7.3: How We Can Cancel for Non-Payment of Premium

“In case of non-payment of premium, we may give you a notice in writing. We must give you ten days notice if we deliver the notice in person, or 30 days notice by sending the notice by registered mail to your last known address. The 30-day period starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter. The notice will inform you that you have until noon of the business day before the last day of the notice period to pay the arrears, plus an administration fee, failing which the policy will automatically be cancelled effective at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the notice period. If you pay the arrears and the administration fee in time, then your policy will not be cancelled.

But if we have already given you two notices of non-payment of premium during the term of your policy and a non-payment occurs again, we don’t have to give you another notice under this section; instead we may cancel your policy as described in section 1.7.4.”

9.3.8.1.6.4 Section 1.7.4: How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-Payment or Other Reasons

“If we cancel your insurance for non-payment of premium because we have already given you two notices during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, or if we cancel for any other reason, we will notify you in writing. We must give you five days notice if we deliver the notice of cancellation in person, or 15 days notice by sending the notice of cancellation by registered mail to your last known address. The 15-day period starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter. If the notice was given because we have already given you two notices of non-payment during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, we are under no obligation to accept a late payment or to keep the policy in force after the effective date of cancellation.”

9.3.8.1.7 SECTION 1.8: WHO AND WHAT WE WON’T COVER

9.3.8.1.7.1 Section 1.8.1: General Exclusion

Section 1.8.1: General Exclusion states that the vehicle is not to be used to carry explosives or radioactive material, nor will it be used to carry paying passengers (that is, it won’t be used as a taxi or a bus). The definition of “paying passengers” does not include carpools, friends sharing costs, carrying domestic workers, carrying children for activities related to educational programs, carrying elderly or special needs passengers while volunteering within the community, or carrying current or prospective clients and/or customers.

The wording in this section begins with the phrase: “Except for certain Accident Benefits coverage, there is no coverage under this policy if…”. There are two very important points within this phrase. Sections 1.8.1: General Exclusion to 1.8.5: Losses Due to War Activities Not Covered list uses and drivers of the automobile that the policy does not cover.

Neither the driver’s potential legal liability, nor the potential damage to the vehicle itself, will be covered if any of these uses occur or if any of these excluded drivers operate the vehicle. These exclusions represent risks that the OAP 1 was never meant to insure. Coverage can be purchased to allow these activities, either through (1) endorsement and an additional premium or (2) a different insurance policy altogether.

While the vehicle and the operator’s liability are not covered if any of the listed activities take place, there is a provision to ensure that the party in breach of these contract conditions will still receive some coverage for medical expenses if there is an accident causing injury or death. We’ll cover this in Section 9.3.8.4: Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage. Aside from certain accident benefits coverages, there is no coverage, even for occupants in the vehicle, if the automobile is operated by a person without the owner’s consent or by a driver specifically excluded from this policy.

9.3.8.2 Section 2: What Automobiles Are Covered

Section 2: What Automobiles Are Covered explains coverages applicable to:

• Described automobiles.

• Extending the policy to other automobiles.

• When the insured has two or more automobiles.

• Trailers and towing.

• Inspection.

9.3.8.2.1 Section 2.1: Described Automobile

A described automobile is any automobile or trailer (or motorized snow vehicle, motorcycle, or ATV) specifically shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows which coverages were purchased for each described automobile. The coverages should include Section 3: Liability Coverage, Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage, Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage, Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage, and Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional).

9.3.8.2.2 Section 2.2: Extending Your Insurance to Other Automobiles

9.3.8.2.2.1 Section 2.2.1: Newly Acquired Automobiles

Newly acquired automobiles are either replacement automobiles (that is, a trade-in car) or additional automobiles (that is, a new car while keeping the old one). The new vehicle will have the same coverage as the vehicle it replaces, up to 14 days from the date it was purchased, provided the vehicle is not insured somewhere else. The 14-day window allows the insured enough time to arrange insurance on the new vehicle.

However, this time period is not free coverage. An endorsement needs to be processed to add the new vehicle, effective to the purchase date; this allows the insurer to collect for the coverage it is providing. This additional automobile extension can be a little difficult to understand, but there are two important points to know:

1) The policy states that, for any extension of coverage to apply, all the owned automobiles must be insured with the same insurer. The extension of coverage is an accommodation by the insurers for their insureds. If all vehicles are insured with one company, then it is a logical assumption that any new vehicle will also be insured with the same company. If vehicles are insured with more than one company, neither company will grant the extension, as there is no guarantee that the automobile will eventually be insured through them. If the business is not going to be placed with a particular insurer, the insurer will not grant the extension.

2) The policy states that the coverage provided under the automatic extension to an additional newly acquired automobile will be determined by the coverages in place on all owned automobiles. For example, for collision coverage to apply, collision coverage must be in place on all vehicles.

9.3.8.2.2.2 Section 2.2.2: Temporary Substitute Automobile

A “temporary substitute automobile” is defined as an automobile not owned by the insured or anyone else living in the insured’s dwelling that is temporarily used while the described automobile is out of service. The described automobile must be temporarily out of service due to breakdown, repair, servicing, theft, sale, or destruction.

The following coverages apply to a temporary substitute automobile, provided that a premium is shown for them on a Certificate of Automobile Insurance for the described automobile that is temporarily unavailable:

• Section 3: Liability Coverage.

• Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

• Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage.

If a premium is paid for physical damage coverages on the described automobile (found in all perils, collision, comprehensive or specified perils coverages), and the driver is involved in an accident while driving a temporary substitute automobile, the physical damage coverage will respond secondary to the coverage already in place on the vehicle (refer to Section 7.4.3: Temporary Substitute Automobile Covered).

Let’s look at an example:

Image

Dennis owns a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu and has it insured with $1,000,000 of liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, each with a $500 deductible. He needs to take it in for an oil change, so he borrows a car from his friend, Arif, for the afternoon.

Arif owns a 2019 Ford 150 truck. The Ford is also insured for $1,000,000, with collision and comprehensive coverage, although the deductibles on it are considerably higher (at $2,500 each). While driving the Ford, Dennis loses control and drives it into a tree at high speed.

The cost of a new fender and hood is approximately $18,000. Arif’s policy will pay for the damage first, as his policy is primary on the Ford. Arif will receive a cheque for $15,500 from his insurer, representing the $18,000 loss minus the $2,500 deductible.

Dennis could then claim $2,000 from his own insurer, as the Ford was a temporary substitute automobile in this case. His policy would pay Arif $2,000, representing the loss of $2,500 minus Dennis’s $500 deductible.

Note: A temporary substitute automobile cannot be owned by the insured or anyone living in the same dwelling as the insured.

9.3.8.2.2.3 Section 2.2.3: Other Automobiles

Automobiles other than the described automobile (that is, not the primary vehicle, but possibly a temporary substitute or newly acquired vehicle) are covered when driven by the insured or driven by their spouse, who lives with the insured.

The following coverage applies to other automobiles if a premium for it is shown on a Certificate of Automobile Insurance for a described automobile:

• Section 3: Liability Coverage.

• Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

• Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage.

Note: Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) are not available for other automobiles.

9.3.8.2.2.4 Section 2.2.4: Other Automobiles that Are Rented or Leased

Rented automobiles also fall within the definition of “other automobile.” This means it qualifies for the four legally required coverages, but only when the automobile is driven by the named insured or their spouse who lives with them.

The OAP 1 includes coverage for rented automobiles with a gross vehicle weight in excess of 4,500 kilograms, only if the rental is for personal use and rented for up to seven days. Rented automobiles with a gross vehicle weight of less than 4,500 kilograms have no time limit. This category of automobiles is specifically described to provide liability coverage when others drive automobiles rented or leased by the named insured with their permission.

If the driver is negligent in the operation of the vehicle, the insured is still protected against liability imposed by law upon them as the renter. This is a new addition to the OAP 1 as of January 2007, and it is now in place due to recent legislation changing the priority of policy coverage on rented or leased automobiles. You can find more information about this in Section 9.3.8.3: Section 3: Liability Coverage.

9.3.8.2.2.5 Section 2.2.5: Trailers

Any trailer used in connection with the described automobile is insured for the following coverages:

• Section 3: Liability Coverage.

• Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

• Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

Note that if the insured owns a trailer and it is not described in the policy, it would also be covered for Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage Coverage, provided (1) that it is attached to an automobile with a manufacturer’s gross weight rating of not more than 4,500 kilograms, or (2) that it is not attached to an automobile and is normally used with an automobile with a manufacturer’s gross weight rating of not more than 4,500 kilograms. In addition, it must not be designed or used for living in, for carrying passengers, or for commercial purposes.

9.3.8.2.3 Section 2.3: When You Have Two or More Automobiles Insured

When there are two automobiles insured under the same policy, each vehicle will be treated as if it were insured on a separate policy.

Let’s look at two examples.

First:

Image

Hannah owns two vehicles. Vehicle One is insured for $1,000,000 of liability, and Vehicle Two is insured for $500,000 of liability. Both are insured on the same policy. If Hannah were involved in an accident causing bodily injury or property damage to a third party, the limit of coverage would depend upon which car was involved. If Vehicle One were involved, she would be covered for up to $1,000,000 of damages. If Vehicle Two were involved, she would be covered for up to only $500,000 of damages.

If Hannah were involved in an accident while driving a vehicle she did not own, the unowned vehicle would be considered an “other automobile” by the policy’s definition, and she would be covered for up to $1,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party, the highest limit on her policy.

Second:

Image

Howard owns two vehicles. Vehicle One is insured for $1,000,000 of liability under a contract with ABC Insurance and Vehicle Two is insured for $500,000 of liability under a contract with XYZ Insurance.

If Howard were involved in an accident while driving a vehicle he did not own, the unowned vehicle would be considered an “other automobile” by both policies’ definitions, since both contracts are the OAP 1. Howard, like Hannah, would be covered for up to $1,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party, the highest single limit of liability insurance purchased by him on one vehicle.

However, the difficulty arises when determining how much each insurer, ABC and XYZ, should be forced to pay in the event of a loss. The policies state: “The amount we will pay under this policy for any incident will be a fraction of the highest policy limit. This fraction will be the proportion that the limit under this policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies.”

In this example, we have two policies: ABC’s contract covers $1,000,000 of liability, and XYZ’s contract covers $500,000. The total of liability limits in this case is $1,500,000. When the statement above is applied to ABC’s policy, ABC will pay the claim in the proportion that $1,000,000 bears to $1,500,000. The simplest way to think of this statement is to convert it to a fraction.

$1,000,000 ÷ $1,500,000 = 2/3 or 0.66

Therefore, ABC will pay 66% of the claim. or up to $666,666.66.

Applying the math to XYZ works in the same way:

$500,000 ÷ $1,500,000 = 1/3 or 0.33.

Therefore, XYZ will pay 33% of the claim, or up to $333,333.33.

9.3.8.2.4 Section 2.4: Trailers and Towing

“An automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when determining how much we will pay under Liability, Accident Benefits and Uninsured Automobile Coverages. However, they will be treated as separate automobiles when determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under Direct Compensation – Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage Coverages.”

9.3.8.2.5 Section 2.5: Inspection

“We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. If you do not co-operate inany reasonable arrangements for inspection, your optional Loss or Damage Coverages under Section 7 may be cancelled and any claims under that Section may be denied.”

9.3.8.3 Section 3: Liability Coverage

Section 3: Liability Coverage describes what the insurance company will cover if a third party is killed or injured in an accident or their property is damaged when the driver or other insured persons are involved in an at-fault accident.

This section describes in detail:

• Who is covered.

• What is covered.

• The insured’s and other insured persons’ responsibilities under the contract.

9.3.8.3.1 Section 3.2: Who is Covered?

The definition of “insured persons” under Section 3.2: Who is Covered? includes:

• The named insured.

• Anyone who, with permission of the named insured, personally drives the vehicle.

• Anyone who, with permission of the named insured, personally operates a part of the vehicle (for example, rolls down the window or opens the hood).

9.3.8.3.2 Section 3.3: What We Cover

Section 3.3: What We Cover is designed to provide coverage for liability imposed upon the named insured or other insured persons for bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party as a result of an automobile accident within Canada or the United States. The policy will make payments that the law requires on the named insured’s or other insured’s behalf, up to the limit of the policy.

It includes a provision for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses suffered by the insured for any immediate medical aid provided to any injured third parties involved in an accident. For example, if an insured is required to pay an ambulance fee or a fee for paramedic services or medical aid to someone else, the policy will pay back the insured for these costs. This amount is paid without affecting the limit of coverage purchased.

Once notification is given to the insurer that a third-party loss has occurred, the insurer will investigate, negotiate with the injured party, and make a settlement of the claim on behalf of the insured. The limit of liability purchased is reserved specifically to compensate third parties for property damage or bodily injury caused by the actions of the insured.

9.3.8.3.2.1 Section 3.3.1: If Someone Sues You

By purchasing the policy, the insured agrees that, if someone presses a lawsuit against them in Canada or the United States, the insurance company will provide the insured’s legal representation — the policy states “you or other insured persons irrevocably appoint us to act on your or their behalf.” The insured must be represented by the insurer; they cannot appoint their own legal representative. The insurer agrees to pay all costs associated with the defence of the suit, including any investigation costs appropriate, court costs levied against the insured, and any post-judgment interest accruing on that portion of the judgment that is within the limit of liability purchased.

If the lawsuit is for an amount greater than the limit of insurance purchased, the insured may appoint a legal representative to defend against the amount of the suit exceeding the policy limit.

9.3.8.3.2.2 Section 3.3.2: How Much We Will Pay

Section 3.3.2: How Much We Will Pay uses an example to illustrate some of the payment provisions explained in Section 3.3.1: If Someone Sues You.

Let’s look at another example.

Image

Tonya was involved in an accident. She lost control of her vehicle and slid on black ice into the back of the car in front of her. After coming to a stop, she realized the driver of that car had hit their head on their steering wheel. She called an ambulance and was later billed $250 for paramedic emergency response. The other driver suffered a permanent, serious disfigurement to their face, and as a result, they filed a lawsuit against Tonya for $1,500,000.

Tonya is insured under an OAP 1 for $1,000,000 of liability. Tonya’s insurer will pay the $250 bill for emergency medical aid on her behalf. Her insurer will then investigate the accident, negotiate with the injured third party, and may attempt to make a settlement out of court with them. If the suit proceeds, the insurer will appoint Tonya a legal representative and defend her against the suit. The insurer will pay all costs for the lawyer appointed to Tonya, the defence cost, and any investigation costs incurred by the insurer.

If Tonya loses the suit, she would have to pay the court costs (usually around $10,000 to $15,000). In her case, the insurer will cover the court costs, and $1,000,000 of the settlement, since that was the amount of insurance purchased. Tonya will be responsible for the remaining $500,000. The insurer will pay post-judgment interest on the portion of the loss insured (in this case, $1,000,000). Tonya will be responsible for the interest on the $500,000 not covered.

9.3.8.3.2.3 Section 3.3.3: Outside Ontario

Section 3.3.3: Outside Ontario states that “If the incident happens in a jurisdiction covered by this policy in which the minimum liability coverage required is higher than the limit shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we will honour the higher amount.” The “minimum limit” referenced here is the lowest amount of legal liability coverage that must be purchased in any jurisdiction. In Canada, insureds must carry at least $200,000 of liability insurance in all common law provinces. In Quebec, insureds must carry $50,000.

If an insured has insured their vehicle to the minimum limit required, the policy will honour the minimum limit in any jurisdiction where coverage is afforded (that is, in Canada and the United States).

Let’s look at an example.

Tinh insured his vehicle for $200,000 of liability on an OAP 1 in January. The province of Nova Scotia has raised their minimum limit to $500,000 for automobile liability insurance. If Tinh took a vacation in Nova Scotia and was subsequently sued for causing an automobile accident there, his Ontario OAP 1 would honour the higher minimum limits in Nova Scotia.

In effect, the minute that Tinh drove over the Nova Scotia border, his Ontario liability increased to the limits required in Nova Scotia.

9.3.8.3.2.4 Section 3.3.4: If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy

Section 3.3.4: If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy explains how insureds under the same policy are protected against lawsuits from each other. Each insured will be treated as if a separate policy had been issued for each of them. However, the maximum amount payable for any one incident will be their purchased liability limit, split between them — not the maximum limit for each insured.

9.3.8.3.2.5 Section 3.3.5: Rented and Leased Automobiles

The OAP 1 provides a special extension of liability to protect the insured against liability imposed due to the negligent operation of a rented or leased automobile by another driver. In 2007, legislation in Ontario changed the order in which different insurance policies covering these rented and leased automobiles should pay if the automobile is involved in an accident causing bodily injury or property damage.

A rented vehicle is covered by both the renter’s OAP 1 and the fleet policy of the company that owns the vehicle being rented. Take Hertz, for example — it has a policy insuring all its automobiles, which means it provides liability insurance for all drivers who rent their vehicles. This legislation makes the renter’s liability coverage respond before the rental car company’s policy will respond. If the renter allows another person to drive the rented vehicle, the renter’s policy responds first, the driver’s policy (if applicable) responds second, and the rental car company’s policy responds third. In all cases, the rental car company’s policy is the last to pay.

Leased vehicles are also subject to this same priority of payment legislation for liability claims. For example, if you lease a vehicle from Honda Financial Services, it will also have an insurance policy covering the leased vehicle. While the lessee’s policy (the OAP 1) is primary, the leasing company will always have a contingent policy to cover the car in case, for some reason, the policy of the lessee does not respond to provide coverage when needed. The leasing company’s policy on a vehicle will always be the last policy called upon to respond to any liability claims brought forward.

Section 3.3.5: Rented and Leased Automobiles offers two examples of how the OAP 1 would respond if a rental car were involved in an accident for which the driver was found to be negligent. In one instance, the renter is driving the vehicle; in the other instance, a friend of the renter is driving the vehicle. In both cases, the rental car company’s insurance policy responds last to the liability claim.

It is also important to note that the rental car company’s insurance limit is provided on a contingent basis only.

Let’s look at an example:

Amelia is going to rent a car from Best Rentals. Best Rentals’s policy has a liability limit of $1,000,000. If Amelia has no automobile of her own (and therefore no OAP 1), then Best Rentals’s policy would respond up to the limit of their coverage to protect Amelia from liability claims.

If Amelia does own her own car (and therefore does have an OAP 1), then Best Rentals’s policy will respond, but only to top up Amelia’s own OAP 1 liability limit to the limit on Best Rentals’s policy. If Amelia has $200,000 of liability coverage under her own OAP 1 policy, this coverage would respond first to any claims, and if exhausted, then Best Rentals’s coverage would step in to pay claims over and above, but only up to the limit of their policy.

9.3.8.3.3 Section 3.4: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities

Section 3.4: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities contains five points, plus a final paragraph in bold letters. Each is a Statutory Condition that the insured must fulfill in order to receive the coverage.

1) The insured must notify the insurer in writing within seven days of any incident involving the loss or damage to persons or property, giving the insurer full details of the incident and the claim arising from it. This is based on Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property, which we will look at later.

2) The insured must make a statutory declaration (sworn affidavit) that the insured or other insured persons were driving the vehicle at the time of the loss. Since the insurer is liable for a potentially very large sum of money on the insured’s behalf, they expect a statement advising the insurer that either the named insured, or somebody with the named insured’s express permission to use the automobile, was involved in the accident. Anybody else driving the automobile at the time of the accident would receive no coverage.

3) The insured must co-operate with all investigative procedures as would be reasonable. Insureds are required to provide information of witnesses to the scene and co-operate in any legal action by the insurer if they ask.

4) The insured must forward any and all legal correspondence received regarding a legal action immediately to the insurer. The insurer is the insured’s irrevocable legal counsel — it’s their responsibility to act upon it.

5) The insured must not assume or admit liability for the incident or try to amicably settle the claim, except at the insured’s own cost. From the insurer’s perspective, this is very important. Admitting liability makes it almost impossible for the insurer to create a defence against any legal action that may follow. Since the insurer is potentially liable for the policy limit to the third party, any admission of responsibility to the third party could be very costly. The insured is also not allowed to interfere with any negotiations towards any settlement by the insurer.

6) Most importantly, the bold final paragraph refers to the absolute liability provision of law. If the insurer has to pay a sum of money due to a provision of law, and the payment was not made under the terms of the policy agreements, the insured is required to repay the insurer all amounts paid to a third party. See Section 9.3.8.3.6: Absolute Liability.

9.3.8.3.4 Summary of Sections 3.3 and 3.4

We’ve covered a lot, so let’s do a quick review. Under Section 3.3: What We Cover, an insurer agrees:

• To investigate, negotiate, and settle claims.

• To pay any amounts the insured is liable for, up to the policy limit.

• To pay out-of-pocket expenses for immediate medical aid.

• To pay defence costs if a suit is brought against the insured.

• To pay court costs assessed against the insured.

• To pay any post-judgment interest accruing on the part of the settlement within the policy limits.

Under Section 3.4: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities, the insured agrees:

• To notify the insurer in writing within seven days of any incident involving bodily injury or property damage to a third party.

• To make a statutory declaration that they, or other insured persons, were operating the vehicle at the time of loss.

• To help the insurer obtain information and co-operate with the insurer in any legal action.

• To forward immediately everything received in writing regarding the claim, including legal documents.

• Not to assume or admit liability.

• Repay the insurer for any amounts it was forced to pay through the absolute liability provision.

9.3.8.3.5 SECTION 3.5: OTHER LIMITATIONS ON YOUR COVERAGE

9.3.8.3.5.1 Section 3.5.1: Property Not Covered

Liability insurance is reserved solely to compensate others for property damage or bodily injury caused by the insured. This provision ensures the limit purchased is not used to pay for the insured’s own property or property the insured is responsible for. For example, if the insured strikes their own house with the automobile, liability coverage would not apply. However, the insured’s property policy would respond to such claims for damage.

9.3.8.3.5.2 Section 3.5.2: Contamination of Property

There is no coverage under the policy for property contaminated due to being carried in the automobile.

9.3.8.3.5.3 Section 3.5.3: Nuclear Hazards

There is no coverage under the OAP 1 for liability caused by nuclear hazards, unless the insured also has a nuclear energy hazard liability policy. The coverage, if provided, is limited to $200,000 regardless of the liability amount purchased and is excess to this other policy only.

9.3.8.3.6 Absolute Liability

Each province’s Insurance Act contains clauses commonly referred to as the absolute liability provision. Absolute liability is designed to protect innocent third parties when a policyholder has violated a term or condition of their contract and, as a consequence, voided their policy. It allows the injured third party access to the money under an insurance contract regardless of any act or breach of the policy by the insured.

The injured party’s right to recover the insurance money payable under the policy shall not be prejudiced by:

• Any assignment, waiver, surrender, cancellation, or discharge of the policy by the insured after the event giving rise to the claim.

• Any act or default of the insured before or after the event in violation of the Insurance Act or the policy.

• Any violation of the Criminal Code of Canada or statute of any province by the owner or driver of the automobile.

9.3.8.3.7 Laws Restricting Legal Actions for Automobile Accidents in Ontario

9.3.8.3.7.1 Tort Provisions
Requirements and details for torts: Bill 59 (1996), Bill 198 (2002), Bill 5 (2003), including Ontario Regulation 34/10 (2010)

• Damages subject to collateral source benefits, including no fault benefits.
Non-economic loss: Deductible 	The schedule of amounts changes from time to time. Find the updated schedule on IBAO’s website https://www.ibao.org/materials/ontario-auto/.

9.3.8.3.7.2 Limitation Period

Civil proceedings to recover damages for injuries arising from a motor vehicle accident must be started within two years of the incident. Any court proceeding used to enforce the entitlement of coverages available according to the SABS must be started within two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the claimed benefit.

9.3.8.3.7.3 Tort Framework Recovery for Pecuniary (Economic) Losses

Effective November 1, 1996, the right to sue for economic losses was reinstated for all accident victims who were not at fault in causing an accident and who suffered a loss to either income or earning capacity due to bodily injuries, or death, while using or operating the automobile.

The innocent party can recover damages for income loss and loss of capacity from the tortfeasor. However, this amount will be a maximum of 70% of gross income from the period commencing seven days after the accident up to and including the date of trial. An innocent party will not be entitled to claim damages against at-fault parties for any damages suffered in the first seven days after the accident. After the trial, the innocent party will be entitled to recover damages on a 100% gross basis for future economic losses from the tort-feasor.

9.3.8.3.7.4 Non-Pecuniary (Non-Economic) Losses

When someone files a claim that is a non-pecuniary loss due to a motor vehicle accident, or even by the use or operation of an automobile, any fatal injury or injury that meets the threshold (as described below) can be counted as a non-pecuniary loss.

9.3.8.3.7.4.1 Threshold

In a threshold-based system, people are prohibited from taking legal action until a certain point has been passed. There are two common types of thresholds: monetary and verbal.

Under the OAP 1, the threshold indicates the degree of severity of an injury caused in an automobile accident in Ontario to enable the injured party to bring an action (known as a tort) against the at-fault party who caused their injuries. In simpler terms, the policyholders must be harmed “at least this much” to sue for their injuries.

To meet the threshold, the injured person must be able to show that they have:

• Died.

• Suffered a permanent, serious disfigurement.

• Suffered a permanent, serious impairment of an important physical, mental, or psychological function.

The individual is then entitled to commence a civil proceeding for the recovery of non-pecuniary losses (also known as “pain and suffering”), provided that the individual was not at fault and falls into one of the following categories:

• The individual was the owner of the automobile.

• The individual was an occupant of the automobile.

• The individual was present at the incident.

9.3.8.3.7.4.2 Deductibles for Non-Pecuniary Awards

As of October 1, 2003, a plaintiff who obtains a judgment or a settlement for non-pecuniary loss must pay a deductible on the current non-economic loss settlement. As you learned earlier, the Government of Ontario updates this deductible dollar amount from time to time. This deductible applies to each person included in the award. An exception to the per person deductible exists in the Family Law Act, Section 61(2)(e). This will reduce the deductible (this amount is also updated by the Government of Ontario from time to time) per person for suits pertaining to the loss of a parent or guardian, or “loss of care, guidance or companionship” claims.

For example, if a legal couple wins a $1,000,000 settlement, then each person pays the deductible. For the current year’s deductible, see the Ontario Auto Brochure:

https://www.ibao.org/materials/ontario-auto/.

9.3.8.3.7.4.3 Motion to Determine if Non-Pecuniary Threshold Has Been Met

Either a plaintiff or an insurer, on consent, can make a motion in a trial to determine if the verbal threshold for non-pecuniary loss has been satisfied. In addition, a judge may make an order to determine whether the threshold has been met, even if set out in the pretrial conference. An order made by a judge on a motion is binding on all parties at trial.

9.3.8.3.7.4.4 Motion to Determine if Health Care Expenses Threshold Has Been Met

Either a plaintiff or an insurer defending a claim may make a motion on consent to determine whether an injury meets the definition of “catastrophic impairment” before the trial. Conversely, a judge may determine whether the threshold has been met before the trial, if it is set out in an order by a judge who conducts the pretrial conference.

Catastrophic impairment includes:

• Paraplegia or quadriplegia.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both arms.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both an arm and a leg.

• Total loss of vision in both eyes.

• Brain impairment as defined by the rating system approved by Insurance Act and SABS regulations.

• Any impairment or combination of impairments that result in 55% or more impairment of the whole person according to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.

• A mental or behavioural impairment that creates a marked or extreme impairment. The impairment must preclude useful functioning.

Note: Since Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage is designed to cover all health care expenses sustained by the insured, there is no requirement to allow for the recovery of such expenses through tort proceedings unless the injured party has sustained a catastrophic impairment. Due to the severe nature of catastrophic impairment, it is very likely that some injuries could totally exhaust the limit provided in the medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care coverage in Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage. This is a key area of insurance that the general public is unaware of, and brokers can help explain it to them.

9.3.8.3.7.5 Uninsured Owner or Lessee Precluded from Commencing Civil Proceedings

An injured individual is precluded from commencing a civil proceeding to recover damages for personal injury or economic loss arising from a motor vehicle accident when the vehicle was uninsured. This rule applies whether they were an owner or lessee of an automobile at the time of the accident and was operating it, or if they were an occupant in their own vehicle at the time of the accident.

To further deter owners from driving without prerequisite insurance, the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act was amended to substantially increase the fines for driving without insurance. Upon conviction, for a first offence, fines will range between $5,000 and $25,000; upon a subsequent conviction, fines will range from $10,000 to $50,000.

9.3.8.4 Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage

As of June 1, 2016, the SABS was amended through the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability Act (Bill 59). This act and its amendments set the basic limits to the statutory accident benefits for injured individuals.

Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage explains:

• Who is covered.

• Types and benefits.

• How to apply for benefits.

• Limitations on coverage.

All insureds have the option of purchasing additional coverage in the following categories:

• Income replacement.

• Caregiver benefit.

• Dependant care benefit.

• Medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care.

• Death and funeral benefit.

• Indexation of benefits payable.

The process requires insurers to advise applicants of coverages and categories that they are entitled to apply for. Every effort must be made to ensure that the public is fully aware of the protection afforded by the OAP 1.

Let’s look at the basic accident scenarios under Ontario’s no-fault insurance rules when different types of accidents require accident benefits to respond.

1) At fault with both parties insured: Non-catastrophic injuries

Image

When an accident doesn’t involve catastrophic injuries, each person’s insurance will respond, regardless of fault. Accident benefits are covered by each person’s insurer (note that the arrows point away from the other party).

2) At fault with both parties insured: Catastrophic injuries

Image

When an accident involves catastrophic injuries, here is how the claims process works:

1) At-fault party seeks Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage from their insurer.

2) Not-at-fault party first seeks Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage from their insurer.

3) Not-at-fault party then sues at-fault party’s Section 3: Liability Coverage for residual damage not covered under their own Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage.

9.3.8.4.1 Section 4.1: Who is Covered?

For accidents which occur in Ontario involving the described automobile (or other insured automobile), “insured person” means:

• The named insured, their spouse, and the dependants of either spouse.

• Persons specified as operators of the automobile or listed as drivers in the policy.

• Any other person involved in an accident involving the insured automobile, if they cannot access their own statutory accident benefits (that is, if they do not own a vehicle or have no insurance).

For accidents which occur outside of Ontario, “insured person” means:

• The named insured, their spouse, and the dependants of either spouse.

• A person who is an occupant of the insured automobile and who is a resident of Ontario or was a resident of Ontario at some point during the 60 days before the accident.

Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage includes coverage for the named insured, their spouse, and any dependant of either who is not involved in the accident, but who suffers psychological or mental injury as a result of an accident causing physical injuries to defined family members.

Since there is usually more than one vehicle involved in an automobile accident, there are priority of payment rules to prevent injured insureds from claiming from multiple policies for their injuries. Claimants for accident benefits must claim based on the priority of payments schedule below:

1) Injured persons claim from their own/their spouse’s insurer.

2) If no insurance exists, injured parties claim from the insurer of the vehicle in which they were an occupant at the time of the accident.

3) If no insurance exists there, injured parties claim from the insurer of any other vehicle involved in the accident.

4) If no vehicles involved in the accident are insured, injured parties can claim for their injuries from the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (MVACF).29

9.3.8.4.2 Section 4.2: Types and Benefits

9.3.8.4.2.1 Income Replacement Benefit

Income replacement benefit is available to a person (named insured or not) who sustains impairment as a result of an accident and satisfies one of the following two criteria:

1) They were employed at the time of the accident, and as a result of the accident, and within 104 weeks of the accident, suffer a substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of that employment.

2) They were unemployed at the time of the accident; however:

a) They were employed for at least 26 weeks during the 52-week period or were receiving benefits under the Employment Insurance Act;

b) They were 16 years of age or more or were excused from attendance at school under the Education Act at the time of the accident; and

c) As a result of and within 104 weeks after the accident, they suffer a substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of the employment in which they spent the most time during the 52 weeks before the accident.

The insurer is not required to pay an income replacement benefit:

• For the first seven days of disability.

• For any period longer than 104 weeks of disability, unless an injured person, as a result of the accident, can demonstrate that they are suffering from a complete inability to engage in any employment by which they are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. If the insured person qualifies for the benefits pursuant to a written contract as noted above, the insurer does not have to pay the benefit for the period before the day they would have been entitled to commence employment pursuant to the contract.

The amount of the income replacement benefit will be calculated as follows:

• For the first 104 weeks of disability, the insured is entitled to 70% of their gross weekly income from employment. An individual’s net weekly income is equal to their gross weekly income minus the premium payable under the Employment Insurance Act of Canada, the contribution payable under the Canada Pension Plan, and the income tax payable under the Income Tax Act of Canada and the Income Tax Act of Ontario. The maximum payable under the SABS is $400 a week.

• For each week after the first 104 weeks of disability, the insured is entitled to the greater of (1) the amount specified in the above paragraph or (2) $185.

All payments made under Section 4: Accidents Benefits Coverage shall be reduced by amounts equal to:

• Net weekly payments for loss of income that have been received by the person as a result of an accident under the laws of any jurisdiction or under any income continuation plan.

• Net weekly payments for loss of income that are not being received by the person, but are available to the person as a result of an accident under the laws of any jurisdiction or under any income continuation plan, unless the person has applied to receive payments for loss of income.

However, the following will not reduce the basic income replacement benefit:

• Benefits under the Employment Insurance Act.

• Benefits under a sick leave plan that are not being received by the person, but are available to the person.

• Payments under any workers’ compensation plan which the person is not entitled to receive because the person has elected to bring an action against the responsible third party.

Note that the income replacement benefit can exceed the 104-week period if the disability extends beyond 104 weeks since the date of the accident. In these situations, the eligibility criteria for receiving the benefit are elevated as follows:

• From the date of accident up to 104 weeks, does the insured have substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of the primary employment?

• Past 104 weeks, does the insured have complete inability to engage in any employment for which they are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience?

If the courts adopt a conservative interpretation of “complete inability” to engage in any employment for which an insured is reasonably suited by education, training, or experience, it would be very difficult for the insured to obtain benefits past the 104-week period.

9.3.8.4.2.1.1 Self-Employment

A self-employed person (named insured or not) will receive 70% of their gross income loss, as reported to Revenue Canada at the end of the previous tax season. A self-employed person’s weekly income or loss from self-employment at the time of the accident is the amount that would be 1/52 of their income or loss from the business for the last completed taxation year as determined by the Income Tax Act.

9.3.8.4.2.1.2 Cost of Report

If an accountant is hired to prepare the application for the income replacement benefit, the insurer will contribute a maximum of $2,500 for the preparation of one or more reports for the purpose of determining an insured person’s entitlement to an income replacement benefit.

9.3.8.4.2.1.3 Non-Earner Benefit

For a person (named insured or not) to be entitled to the non-earner benefit, they must meet the following criteria:

• The impairment must completely preclude them from carrying on a normal life within the 104 weeks after the accident.

• They must not be eligible for any income replacement benefits.

• They suffer impairment as a result of the motor vehicle accident.

• If they received a caregiver benefit, there is no longer a person in need of care.

In addition, if they meet the above criteria and were enrolled on a full-time basis in elementary, secondary, or post-secondary education at the time of the accident or completed their education less than a year before the accident, the person may be eligible to receive this benefit.

The non-earner benefit is not payable for the first four weeks after the accident. Once it becomes payable, the non-earner benefit provides $185 for each week the person continues to satisfy the criteria. This coverage is available for two years after the date of the accident.

9.3.8.4.2.2 Caregiver Benefit

A person (named insured or not) is entitled to the caregiver benefit if they sustain a catastrophic impairment as a result of a motor vehicle accident and:

• Resided with a person in need of care;

• Were the primary caregiver for the person in need of care; and

• Did not receive any remuneration for performing the caregiving activities.

The caregiver must, within 104 weeks of the date of the accident, be substantially unable to engage in the caregiving activities which were performed at the time of the accident.

Although the insurer is obligated to compensate an individual for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred, the insurer will only be responsible for a maximum of $250 per week for the first person in need of care, and a maximum of $50 per week for each additional person in need of care.

After the first 104 weeks of disability, an insurer is no longer obligated to continue payment of the caregiver benefit unless a claimant can demonstrate that, as a result of the accident, they suffered a complete inability to carry on a normal life. The caregiver benefit can be added by endorsement and additional premium for non-catastrophic injuries.

9.3.8.4.2.3 Medical, Rehabilitation, and Attendant Care Benefits

9.3.8.4.2.3.1 Medical Benefit

The medical benefit pays for all reasonable medical expenses incurred which are not covered under another insurance plan or provincial health care plan. Expenses recoverable include:

• Medical, surgical, dental, optometric, hospital, nursing, ambulance, audiometric, and speech language pathology services.

• Chiropractic, psychological, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy services.

• Medication.

• Prescription eyewear.

• Dentures and other dental devices.

• Hearing aids, wheelchairs, and other mobility devices, prosthesis, orthotics, and other assistive devices.

• Transportation for the insured person to and from treatment sessions, including transportation for an aide or attendant.

• Other goods and services of a medical nature that the insured person requires.

9.3.8.4.2.3.2 Rehabilitation Benefit

The rehabilitation benefit covers not only the medical rehabilitation costs from an accident, but also the social rehabilitation costs associated with retraining and re-education. Examples of these expenses are:

• Life skills training.

• Family counselling.

• Social rehabilitation counselling.

• Financial counselling.

• Employment counselling.

• Vocational assessments.

• Vocational or academic training.

• Workplace modifications and workplace devices, including communication aids, to accommodate the needs of the insured person.

• Home modifications and home devices, including communication aids, to accommodate the needs of the insured person, or the purchase of a new home if it is more reasonable to purchase a new home to accommodate the needs of the insured person than to renovate their existing home.

• Vehicle modifications to accommodate the needs of the insured person, or the purchase of a new vehicle if it is more reasonable to purchase a new vehicle to accommodate the needs of the insured person than to modify their existing vehicle.

• Transportation for the insured person to and from counselling sessions, training sessions, and assessments, including transportation for an aide or attendant.

• Other goods and services that the insured person requires, except services provided by a case manager.

9.3.8.4.2.3.3 Attendant Care Benefit

The attendant care benefit reimburses an attendant to look after the insured either at home or within a health care facility.

Note: For more information about time limits on benefits, see Section 20 of the SABS.

9.3.8.4.2.3.4 Maximum Basic Limits on Medical, Rehabilitation, and Attendant Care Benefits

For minor injuries, the insurer is not obligated to pay more than $3,500 in medical and rehabilitation benefits and assessments, and there are no payments made for attendant care. If the injury is non-minor/non catastrophic, the insurer will pay a maximum of $65,000 for medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits, combined. If the injury is catastrophic, the insurer will pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for all medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefits, combined.

Transportation expenses to and from treatment sessions will be paid in accordance with the Transportation Expense Schedule created by the Ontario Insurance Commission (now under the FSRA). If the insured uses their own vehicle to commute back and forth to treatment sessions, they cannot claim reimbursement of expenses for the first 50 kilometres per visit, per round trip.

9.3.8.4.2.4 Death and Funeral Benefits

The insurer must pay all funeral expenses incurred, to a maximum of $6,000, for the death of an insured.

If an insured person dies within 180 days of an automobile accident, or within 156 weeks of the accident if the person was continuously disabled as a result of the accident, the insurer will pay $25,000 to their spouse and $10,000 to each of the insured’s dependants. To each person to whom the insured person had an obligation to provide support under a court order or domestic contract, the insurer will pay $10,000. If the insured person did not have a spouse at the time of their death, the insurer is obligated to pay the $25,000 spousal entitlement to any legal dependant, over and above the $10,000 already paid to them. If there is more than one dependant, the sum is shared equally between them. If the deceased was a dependant, $10,000 will be paid to the person depended upon (for example, their parents or guardian).

In addition, if the insured was obligated by a domestic contract or a court order to make payments to a former spouse at the time of their death, the former spouse is entitled to receive a payment of $10,000 from the insurer.

For any of the individuals noted above to become entitled to the payments as outlined, they must survive the insured person by at least 30 days. If there are no surviving dependants, there will be no death benefit.

9.3.8.4.2.5 Other Expenses Covered

9.3.8.4.2.5.1 Lost Educational Expenses

If the insured was enrolled in an elementary, secondary, post-secondary, or continuing education program at the time of the accident, and they are unable to continue the educational program as a consequence of the accident and an ensuing impairment, the insurer is liable to reimburse the insured up to $15,000.

The term “educational expenses” includes expenses incurred for the following items before the date of the accident:

• Tuition.

• Books.

• Equipment or room and board associated with the educational program, provided that these expenses have a reasonable connection to the educational programs in which the insured has been precluded from attending as a result of the accident.

9.3.8.4.2.5.2 Visitor Expenses

If an insured suffers impairment as a result of an accident, the insurer is obligated to pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by any individual as designated in Section 22(1) of the SABS who visits the insured person during their treatment or subsequent recovery. Unless the insured person has suffered a catastrophic impairment, the insurer is only obligated to pay expenses under this category up to 104 weeks from the date of the accident.

9.3.8.4.2.5.3 Housekeeping and Home Maintenance

If, as a result of an accident, the insured suffers a catastrophic impairment that renders them substantially incapable of performing housekeeping and home maintenance activities that they customarily engaged in before the accident, the insurer is liable to reimburse the insured for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred.

The maximum amount that an insurer is obligated to pay under the housekeeping and home maintenance expense category is $100 per week. In addition, unless the insured has suffered a catastrophic injury, the insurer is not required to make any payment for expenses incurred more than 104 weeks after the onset of the compensable disability. Coverage for housekeeping and home maintenance for non-catastrophic injuries can be added by endorsement and for an additional premium.

9.3.8.4.2.5.4 Damage to Clothing, Glasses, Hearing Aids, etc.

If claims for expenses under this category are reasonable and were incurred as a direct result of the motor vehicle accident by the insured or an individual on their behalf, an insurer is obligated to provide compensation for the repair or replacement of the miscellaneous articles logically falling within this category.

9.3.8.4.2.5.5 Cost of Examinations

The insurer will pay reasonable expenses on behalf of an insured person for assessments, reports, and fees of a health practitioner (including approving treatment plans) pursuant to the provisions of the SABS. The maximum an insurer will pay is $2,000 for fees for any one assessment or examination. The insurer will not pay for fees for preparing a future plan, a life care plan, or any assessment or examination conducted in connection with the preparation of the plan.

9.3.8.4.2.6 Optional Benefits

Insurers are obligated to inform all applicants about the following optional benefits.

• Optional income replacement benefits: The insured has an option of selecting the sum of $600, $800, or $1,000 as the maximum amount of an income replacement benefit. The provision maximizing the benefit to 70% of the insured’s gross weekly income will remain.

• Optional caregiver, housekeeping, and home maintenance benefits: The insured can elect to amend the basic coverage to have these benefits apply to a non-catastrophic injury.

The following conditions apply:

- The optional benefit applies if the insured person suffers a substantial inability to engage in caregiving activities in which they were engaged at the time of the accident.

- The optional benefit is limited to 104 weeks of disability unless, as a result of the accident, the insured person suffers a complete inability to carry on a normal life.

- The housekeeping and home maintenance benefit does not apply for expenses incurred more than 104 weeks after the onset of the disability.

- The optional benefit does not increase the weekly benefits as indicated in the basic caregiver benefit and housekeeping and home maintenance benefit.

• Optional dependant care benefit: The insurer will pay for reasonable and necessary additional expenses incurred by or on behalf of an insured person in caring for the insured person’s dependants, if:

- The insured person sustained impairment as a result of the accident.

- The insured person was employed at the time of the accident.

- The insured person is not receiving a caregiver benefit.

The dependant care benefit will pay up to $75 per week for the first dependant and $25 per week for each additional dependant, to a maximum of $150 per week.

• Optional combined medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefit: The non-catastrophic injuries basic benefit pays up to $65,000, with a five-year time limit. The non-catastrophic impairment coverage can be doubled up to $130,000. If the insured is catastrophically impaired, the basic benefit pays $1,000,000 for combined expenses. The insured can increase this up to $2,000,000. If the insured chooses to purchase these coverages, it will also increase the payment period from five to 10 years. Here, the insured has the option to increase medical, rehabilitation, and attendant care benefit for catastrophic impairment and all injuries up to a combined total of $2,000,000.

• Increased death and funeral benefit: The basic level of death benefit paid to the surviving spouse ($25,000) and dependant ($10,000) of a person who is killed can be doubled by purchasing this optional coverage. This coverage also increases the basic funeral expense benefit from $6,000 to $8,000.

• Optional indexation benefit: Indexation is commonly considered a cost of living adjustment to benefits, subject to weekly or monthly limits. If the indexation benefit is selected, the indexation will be applied on January 1 of every year following the accident by adjusting the amount payable under the benefit by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Canada, as published by Statistics Canada under the authority of the Statistics Act. This benefit does not apply to the death and funeral benefit.

9.3.8.4.3 Section 4.3: How to Apply for Benefits

9.3.8.4.3.1 Section 4.3.1: Applying for Benefits — Procedures and Time Limits

Section 32(1) of the SABS stipulates that an individual who wants to apply for a benefit should notify the insurer within seven days of the accident. Once notified, the insurer must quickly provide the correct application and a written explanation of the benefits the insured may be entitled to. Upon receiving the application, the insured is expected to submit the application to the insurer within 30 days. If the insurer requires any further information to determine if the insured is entitled to benefits or not, the insured must provide the additional information within 14 days of receiving the request.

9.3.8.4.3.2 Method of Payment for Income Replacement, Non-Earner or Caregiver Benefits

Once the insurer determines the individual is entitled to the identified benefits, they are expected to make the first payment within 14 days after receiving the application. However, if the insurer determines that the individual is not entitled to, or is no longer entitled to, receive income replacement, non-earner, or caregiver benefits, the insurer must provide the insured notice of their determinations, including written reasons, within 14 days after receiving the initial application for benefits (or if an insurer has been paying the benefits, no later than the date the next benefit payment is due).

If an insured has been receiving income replacement, non-earner, or caregiver benefits, upon receiving notice that the insurer has determined to discontinue the benefit, the insured has the right to require an assessment pursuant to Section 47 of the SABS by giving the insurer written notice before the date listed as the terminal (end) date of the benefit. Once the insurer receives this request for an assessment, the insurer is no longer entitled to stop payment of the benefits until they receive a medical assessment.

There are additional reporting procedures for other accident benefits that we won’t describe here — see Sections 38 to 49 of the SABS.

9.3.8.4.3.3 Limitation Period

Any initial proceedings (that is, court or arbitration proceedings) under the Insurance Act regarding these regulated benefits must be commenced within two years after the insurer’s refusal to pay the amount that was claimed.

9.3.8.4.3.4 Minor Injury Guideline

On September 1, 2010, the SABS was updated to include a Minor Injury Guideline.

Under the Minor Injury Guideline, the maximum that will be paid for medical and rehabilitation benefits for a predominantly minor injury shall not exceed $3,500. This limitation will not apply to an insured person if their health practitioner determines and provides compelling evidence that the insured person has a pre-existing medical condition that will prevent them from achieving maximal recovery from the minor injury.

Examples of minor injuries include:

• A sprain.

• A strain.

• Whiplash-associated disorders.

• A contusion.

• An abrasion.

• A laceration or subluxation.

• Any clinically associated sequelae.

The Minor Injury Guideline sets the allowable fees for the initial treatment blocks for continuing treatments, health practitioner monitoring, completion of the Minor Injury Discharge Report (OCF- 24), supplementary goods and services, and X-ray fees.

9.3.8.4.3.5 Recovery of Health Care Expenses for Catastrophic Impairment

When a plaintiff, who is not at fault and has suffered an injury, incurs expenses for health care as a result of an injury directly or indirectly caused by the use or operation of the motor vehicle, they will be entitled to recover damages for health care expenses if the injury meets the verbal threshold of catastrophic impairment.

As we learned from Section 9.3.8.3.7.4.4: Motion to Determine if Health Care Expenses Threshold Has Been Met, catastrophic impairment includes:

• Paraplegia or quadriplegia.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both arms.

• Amputation or other impairment causing the total and permanent loss of use of both an arm and a leg.

• Total loss of vision in both eyes.

• Brain impairment, as defined by the rating system approved by the Insurance Act and SABS regulations.

• Any impairment or combination of impairments that result in 55% or more impairment of the whole person according to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.

• A mental or behavioural impairment that creates a marked or extreme impairment. This impairment must preclude useful functioning.

9.3.8.4.3.6 Deduction for Collateral Source Benefits from Recovery of Health Care Expenses

Recovered health expenses will be reduced by the following amounts:

• All payments available before the trial of the action for statutory accident benefits in respect of the expenses for health care.

• All payments received before the trial of the action under any medical, surgical, dental, hospitalization, rehabilitation, or long-term care plan.

Note: All future collateral source health care benefits must be held in trust and disbursed to those from whom damages were recovered in the action in proportion to the amount those persons paid in damages.

9.3.8.4.3.7 Limitations

Entitlement to income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits, or compensation for other expenses may be reduced or eliminated if an insured is responsible for any of the following infractions:

• Knew or should reasonably have known that they were operating an automobile without insurance. Driving an automobile while not authorized by law to drive.

• Driving an automobile they were specifically excluded from driving under the policy.

• Knowingly operated or should reasonably have known that the automobile was operated without the owner’s consent.

• Made or knew about a material misrepresentation that induced the insurer to issue the policy.

• Intentionally failed to notify the insurer of any significant changes as required under Section 1.4.1 of the OAP 1, which stipulates: “You agree to notify us properly in writing of any significant change of which you are aware of in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of described automobile. You also agree to let us know of any change that might increase the risk of an incident or affect our willingness to insure you at current rates.”

• Are convicted of a criminal offence involving the operation of an automobile.

9.3.8.4.4 Section 4.4: Limitations on Your Coverage

An insurer may refuse the payment of income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits (including students), and other expenses for the driver of an automobile if they:

• Knew or ought reasonably to have known that they were operating an automobile while it was not insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.

• Drive an automobile while not authorized by law to drive, or drive while excluded as a driver under the contract of automobile insurance.

• Drive a vehicle when they knew or ought to have reasonably known that they were operating an automobile without the owner’s consent.

An insured waives all entitlement to income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits, educational expenses, visitors’ expenses, housekeeping benefits, and maintenance expenses if they:

• Made or had knowledge of a material misrepresentation that induced the insurer to enter into a contract of automobile insurance.

• Intentionally failed to notify the insurer of a change in a material risk in the contract.

• Knew or ought to have reasonably known as an occupant that the driver was operating an automobile without the owner’s consent.

An insurer is entitled to hold amounts payable to the insured in trust under income replacement benefits, non-earner benefits, education benefits, visitors’ expenses, or housekeeping and maintenance benefits if the insured has been charged with a criminal offence at the time of the accident and was engaged in, or was an occupant of an automobile used in connection with committing, any of the following criminal offences:

• Operating an automobile while their ability to operate the automobile was impaired by alcohol or drugs.

• Operating an automobile while the concentration of alcohol in the driver’s blood exceeded the amount permitted by law.

• Failing to comply with the laws that command an individual to provide a breath sample.

• Any other criminal offence, whether or not the offence is related to the operation of an automobile.30

Once a criminal charge has been made pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code, the insurer is consequently entitled to retain any amounts payable to the insured in trust pending final disposition of the charge. Once the charge has been disposed of, the insurer will either be entitled to retain the funds or pay the funds out to the insured, depending upon whether the insured was found guilty of the offence.

9.3.8.5 Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage

9.3.8.5.1 Section 5.1: Introduction

Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage is designed to provide some protection for victims of accidents involving uninsured or unidentified drivers and/or automobiles. The Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act in Ontario requires all automobiles operated on public highways to be insured for a minimum of $200,000 of third-party liability coverage.

However, some drivers do continue to drive without insurance. Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage will respond when the insured is struck by an unidentified, identified, and/or uninsured automobile and suffers bodily injury and/or property damage.

Section 5.1: Introduction defines an uninsured automobile as one that neither the owner nor driver has liability insurance to cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of its ownership, use, or operation, or the insurance is not collectible. An unidentified automobile is one whose owner or driver cannot be identified.

Let’s look at the basic accident scenarios under Ontario’s no-fault insurance rules when different types of accidents involving uninsured automobiles require accident benefits to respond.

Image

When the not-at-fault party has catastrophic injuries, they would normally:

1) Collect from their own Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage first.

2) Sue the at-fault party’s Section 3: Liability Coverage for residual damages.

However, note that the at-fault party’s insurance policy is transparent in the diagram. This indicates that they have no insurance. In these situations, there needs to be a third step.

3) Collect from their own Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage for the type of coverage they would have recovered from the at-fault party’s coverage.

9.3.8.5.2 Section 5.2: What We Will Cover

9.3.8.5.2.1 Section 5.2.1: Claims by You or Other Insured Persons for Bodily Injury

The insurer will pay any amounts the insured or other insured persons have a legal right to recover as bodily injury damages from the owner or driver resulting from an accident involving an uninsured or unidentified automobile, up to the limits of this section.

An insured must be legally able to recover damages for bodily injury from the at-fault uninsured party before this coverage will respond. For economic loss suits, this is straightforward; however, claims for pain and suffering require the insured to have suffered a threshold injury. There can be no legal action allowed before the degree of injury sustained meets these minimum criteria.

To claim any bodily injury amounts under this section in Ontario, the injured person must have either:

• Died.

• Suffered a permanent serious disfigurement.

• Suffered a permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental, or psychological function.

The coverage responds as though it were the liability policy of the at-fault party. If the at-fault party is uninsured, Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage pays where the uninsured party’s policy would have paid, if they had one in place. The maximum amount payable under this section of the policy is the minimum limit of liability where the accident took place. In Ontario, the maximum payable for bodily injury claims is $200,000.

9.3.8.5.2.2 Section 5.2.2: Claims by Others for Bodily Injury or Death

If an insured dies as a result of an automobile accident, family members and others may pursue the at-fault motorist for damages caused due to the loss of that individual. Their claims will also be paid by the policy if the at-fault motorist is uninsured.

9.3.8.5.2.3 Section 5.2.3: Claims for Certain Property Damage

If the at-fault driver is identified and uninsured, claims can be made under the policy for damage to and loss of use of the automobile and its contents.

Note that there is no coverage for damage caused to the automobile by any unidentified automobile under this section of the policy. If this coverage were available, it would be open to too many fraud risks. Insureds involved in single-vehicle accidents who had not purchased any physical damage coverage (collision or all-perils), or who had purchased this coverage but did not wish to claim against it due to its effect on their driving record, would almost always claim the damage was caused by a “hit and run” driver.

Payments of property damage claims matching the required uninsured and identified driver requirements are limited to $25,000, and subject to the standard deductible of $300.

9.3.8.5.3 Section 5.3: Claims for Bodily Injury or Death

9.3.8.5.3.1 Section 5.3.1: Who Is Covered?

In Section 5.3.1: Who Is Covered? An “insured person” means:

• Any person who is an occupant of the automobile.

• The named insured, their spouse, and any dependant relative of either when:

- An occupant of an uninsured automobile.

- Not in an automobile, streetcar, or railway vehicle if hit by an unidentified or uninsured automobile (that is, a pedestrian).

Under this definition, the automobile includes any automobile for which coverage is provided under the policy. This includes the described automobile, as well as temporary substitute automobiles, newly acquired automobiles, and other automobiles defined in the policy. Any person who is an occupant in any of the automobiles who suffers a threshold injury caused by an unidentified and/or uninsured motorist can claim under this provision.

The named insured, their spouse, and their dependants can also claim under this provision if they are injured in an automobile accident which is the fault of the driver of the automobile in which they were an occupant, and that driver was uninsured. Again, the injured party would have to be in a legal position to sue, having met the threshold, and the payments would be limited to the minimum limit of insurance required in the state, province, or territory where the accident occurred.

Most importantly, if the insured, their spouse, or their dependant is struck and injured as a pedestrian by an uninsured or unidentified driver, this provision will respond. Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage is perhaps most valuable in these situations.

9.3.8.5.3.2 Section 5.3.4: Conditions Applying to Claims for Bodily Injury or Death

As with all coverage provided by the OAP 1, there are certain conditions placed upon the payment of claims under this section. When claiming bodily injury payments due to a threshold injury caused by an unidentified and/or uninsured motorist, the claimant must:

• Provide the insurer with written notice of the claim within 30 days of the accident. If this is not possible, due to medical reasons or some other equally important reason, the notice must be provided as soon as possible after that.

• Provide the insurer with as much evidence to support the claim as possible. A proof of loss should be submitted to the insurer within 90 days of the accident, giving details of the accident and the resulting loss. Again, if it is not possible to do so within the 90 days required, the claimant must do so as soon as possible after that.

• Provide the insurer with documentary evidence of the injury, whether psychological or medical, from an appropriate medical specialist for the types of injuries claimed for, if requested by the insurer. Documents should state the cause of the injury or death (that is, state that an automobile accident is the proximate cause of the injuries or death) and, i appropriate, state the expected duration of the injuries.

• Provide the insurer with any and all details of any other insurance contract (other than a life insurance contract if the claim is for loss of a family member) under which the claimant may be entitled to recover any other compensation.

9.3.8.5.3.3 Section 5.3.5: Accidents Involving Unidentified Automobiles

When an insured is injured due to an unidentified automobile, the police must be notified of the accident within 24 hours, or as soon as possible after that if the insured or their representative is unable to do so.

A written statement must be made within 30 days of the accident, giving all details of the accident to the insurer. The automobile in which the injured party was an occupant must also be made available for the insurer to inspect at their request.

9.3.8.5.4 Section 5.4: Claims for Property Damage

9.3.8.5.4.1 Section 5.4.2: Conditions Applying to Claims for Property Damage

The conditions applying to claims for property damage are very similar to Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. They are as follows:

• The insured must notify the insurer within seven days of the accident.

• The insured must protect the automobile from further damage, to the best of their ability.

• The insured must not make any repairs beyond those necessary to protect the vehicle from further damage without the permission of the insurer, or until the insurer has had time to inspect the vehicle.

• The insurer must be allowed to copy all legal documents pertaining to the accident.

• The insurer must be allowed to inspect the vehicle at any reasonable time.

• The insured must submit a proof of loss within 90 days.

• The insured cannot abandon the wreckage of the automobile into the care of the insurer unless the insurer has made settlement of the claim for the full actual cash value of the vehicle. At that point, the insurer owns the salvage.

9.3.8.5.4.2 Section 5.4.4: How Much We Will Pay

The insurer’s maximum liability for damage to the automobile is the actual cash value (ACV) of the automobile at the time of the loss, minus the deductible applicable to the coverage shown on the coverage summary page.

An automobile’s ACV is determined by taking its original cost, and then deducting all applicable depreciation from that amount.

For example:

If a vehicle originally cost $25,000 in 2014, by 2023, nine years of depreciation would be subtracted from the original purchase price. If the vehicle was worth $25,000 in 2014, it may be worth only $8,000 in 2021. The mileage driven, the condition of the vehicle, and maintenance schedules all contribute to the amount of depreciation to be subtracted. In very simple terms, a vehicle’s ACV can be thought of as the price the insured could have sold it for immediately prior to the loss.

The insurer will repair the automobile if it is cheaper to do so, with parts of like kind and quality as existed on or within the automobile at the time of the loss (minus the deductible).

9.3.8.5.5 Section 5.5: Claims for Both Bodily Injury and Property Damage

Claims often arise for both bodily injury and property damage caused by the same accident. In these instances, the coverage applicable under this section will be apportioned 95% for bodily injury claims and 5% for the property damage suffered.

Let’s look at an example:

While driving his new Mercedes SL500, Yuri (who is insured) is struck and injured by an uninsured automobile. Yuri suffered a threshold injury, and the damage to his vehicle totals $30,000. If Yuri plans to sue for $300,000 for the bodily injury suffered, the total suit would be for $330,000. Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage pays up to the minimum limit in the province where the accident occurred; in Ontario, this is $200,000. Because the total amount of the claim cannot be paid under this coverage limit, payments are then broken down according to the two parts: $190,000 (95%) for the bodily injury claim and $10,000 (5%) for the property damage claim.

9.3.8.5.6 Section 5.7: Limitations and Exceptions

9.3.8.5.6.1 Section 5.7.1: Payment Limits

Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage is limited to the minimum legal limit of automobile liability insurance in the jurisdiction where the accident occurs. This is the maximum amount payable, regardless of the amount of property damage suffered or the number of victims injured or killed in any single accident.

The insurer will also not pay:

• Anything under this coverage if there exists an automobile liability insurance policy from which the injured insured party can claim.

• Any amount for an accident occurring in a jurisdiction where the injured party may make a claim from an unsatisfied judgment fund or similar fund created for the purpose of compensating victims of uninsured or unidentified motorists.

- The OAP 1 will not pay in any jurisdiction where a fund exists to compensate victims for essentially the same losses. (All provinces in Canada have a Highway Victims Indemnity Fund or Unsatisfied Judgment Fund. The territories do not have a fund, nor do most American states.) Ontario’s Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (our equivalent of a Highway Victims Indemnity Fund), does not recognize any claim from a person insured under a valid insurance policy; therefore, Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage will pay.

• Losses caused by radioactive contamination or radioactive materials.

• The first $300 (standard deductible) of any accidental damage to the automobile or its contents.

• Amounts over $25,000 for damage to the automobile or its contents in any one accident.

• For loss or damage while a person specifically excluded from the policy is driving the automobile.

Before we leave this section, let’s review:

• Coverage is limited to the minimum limit of automobile liability insurance in the jurisdiction where the accident took place. In Ontario, this is $200,000.

• Insurers will pay claims for bodily injury suffered by an insured person caused by uninsured and/or unidentified drivers.

• Insurers will pay claims for property damage to automobiles and their contents caused by identified and uninsured drivers.

• Property damage claims are limited to $25,000 for any one accident and are subject to a standard $300 deductible.

• In the event of a claim for both bodily injury and property damage arising from the same accident, the limit of coverage will be apportioned as 95% ($190,000 in Ontario) for bodily injury claims and 5% ($10,000 in Ontario) for property damage claims.

9.3.8.6 Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage

Coverage under Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage is provided for loss or damage to the insured automobile and certain trailers, their equipment, contents, and their loss of use. In 2024, the Ontario Government introduced a new change form to the OAP 1 that allows a policyholder to remove the DCPD coverage from their policy. DCPD is still a mandatory coverage, but with OPCF 49, it creates an opt-out approach for consumers if they want to save money on their premium. For the purposes of your exam, you do not need to know more about OPCF 49 than awareness of what it is and what it does; the operational details will come when you work in your brokerage.

The basic function of the coverage is to pay for damage occurring to the insured automobile which is not the insured’s fault. For the coverage to apply, the accident must take place in Ontario and must involve at least one other vehicle insured under a motor vehicle liability policy issued by an insurer licensed in Ontario.

If the insured is involved in an accident with another motorist, the natural assumption is that the damage to the insured’s vehicle caused by the other motorist should be paid for by the other motorist. In most other provinces, this would be the case. However, the disadvantage to that system is the time it takes to recover the money to pay for the repairs required. These systems require the insured to pursue a legal action against the at-fault motorist for damages. Court costs, legal fees, and lengthy litigations increase costs for everybody. In the end, the insurers pay the claims through liability coverage, defending these actions and paying court costs over and above the physical damage caused to a vehicle.

In contrast, Section 6: Direct Compensation — Property Damage (DCPD) Coverage is designed to prevent these small lawsuits from having to go to court. All insurers in Ontario pay for damage to their insured’s vehicles under Section 6: DCPD Coverage to the extent (percentage) that the insured is not at fault. The standard deductible for DCPD is $0. However, many insureds decide to add a deductible to help reduce their premium, so we have included deductibles in the examples below.

Let’s use two scenarios to look at how fault is determined under Section 6: DCPD Coverage claims.

Scenario 1

Actual cash value: $25,000

Percentage the insured is not at fault: 100%

Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible elected: $500

Image

Step 1: Determine the degree to which the insured is not at fault (NAF) (100%).

Step 2: Multiply that number by the deductible (D) to determine how much the insured pays.

D: $500 × NAF: 100% = $500

Step 3: Multiply that number by the value of the vehicle (V) to determine how much the insurer pays.

V: $25,000 × NAF: 100% = $25,000

Step 4: Subtract the deductible (D) from the value (V) to determine the payout.

V: $25,000 – D: $500 = $24,500

This means the insured’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay $24,500.

Scenario 2

Actual cash value: $25,000

Percentage the insured is not at fault: 75%

Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible elected: $300

Image

Step 1: Determine the degree to which the insured is not at fault (NAF) (75%).

Step 2: Multiply that number by the deductible (D) to determine how much the insured pays.

D: $300 × NAF: 75% = $225

Step 3: Multiply that number by the value of the vehicle (V) to determine how much the insurer pays.

V: $25,000 × NAF: 75% = $18,750

Step 4: Subtract the deductible (D) from the value (V) to determine the payout.

V: $18,750 – D: $225 = $18,525

This means the insured’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay $18,525.

Let’s consider two more examples. Here’s the first:

Alexei was sitting in his car, stopped at a red light, when he was struck from behind by Randy. In this case, Randy is considered to be 100% at fault for the accident, so Alexei is considered to be 100% not at fault for the accident.

Alexei’s automobile suffers $5,000 damage due to the accident. Alexei’s insurer will pay for the cost of repairs and temporary replacement transportation (for example, rental cars or taxis, buses, etc.) under the Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

And here’s the second:

Jamal and Angela are involved in a collision for which they are both considered to be 50% at fault. Jamal’s vehicle suffers $4,000 damage. His insurer, under the Section 6: DCPD Coverage, will pay only for the portion of the damage which he is not at fault for. He is 50% at fault, which means he is 50% not at fault. Jamal’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay for 50% of the $4,000 damage ($2,000).

We can use the same rationale to determine how much Angela will receive from her insurer under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage. She was determined to be 50% at fault, and 50% not at fault, for the accident. If Angela suffers $2,600 damage to her vehicle, her insurer will pay $1,300 toward the damage under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

The difference between each of their losses and respective payments under Section 6: DCPD Coverage can be claimed under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) if either had purchased the optional collision coverage.

9.3.8.6.1 Section 6.2: What We Will Cover

Section 6.2: What We Will Cover refers to Section 263 of Ontario’s Insurance Act. It states that this portion of coverage is reserved specifically for loss or damage to the automobile, its contents, and its loss of use.

Since the coverage is designed to pay when the insured is not at fault or not responsible for damage caused in an accident, the coverage extends to pay for a replacement automobile or expenses for replacement transportation (for example, a rental car, taxis, buses, etc.). The coverage also pays for any contents of the vehicle which are damaged due to the accident.

With few exceptions, an insured motorist generally cannot sue a negligent motorist in Ontario for damage caused to the insured automobile. The creation of a DCPD agreement between all insurers who insure automobiles in Ontario removes the necessity for lawsuits to recover money for damage caused to an insured’s vehicle by a negligent motorist. Recovery is now made from each insurer when the accident is considered to be the fault of another motorist.

For the Section 6: DCPD Coverage to apply, two conditions must be met:

1) Both vehicles involved in the accident must be insured under automobile policies issued by licensed insurers in Ontario, or insurers from outside Ontario who have agreed to be bound by this section; and

2) The accident must take place in Ontario.

The insurer will not pay more to repair or replace the automobile than its ACV at the time of the loss, less the applicable percentage of the deductible shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance for the coverage.

There is a standard deductible of $500 on the Section 6: DCPD Coverage. However, the policy refers to the applicable percentage of the deductible being deducted from the settlement. If the insured is 100% not at fault for an accident causing $5,000 damage, the insurer will pay $5,000, less 100% of the deductible (or $500), making the total settlement $4,500. If the insured had been 40% at fault and 60% not at fault, the insurer would pay 60% of the $5,000 ($3,000), less 60% of the deductible ($300). The settlement in that case would be $2,700.

Note: Most insureds can pay a higher premium to reduce their deductible to $0.

The bolded sentence (“You should be aware that this coverage does not apply if the automobile is described in another motor vehicle liability policy”) can be difficult to interpret. Here’s what it means: The OAP 1 provides coverage for the described automobile, newly acquired automobiles, temporary substitute automobiles, and other automobiles, as defined earlier in the text. However, Section 6: DCPD Coverage primarily applies to described automobiles and newly acquired automobiles. This is because these are vehicles owned by the named insured; temporary substitute automobiles and other automobiles belong to someone other than the insured. If the owner of the vehicle being driven has an insurance policy covering temporary substitute automobiles,31 the policy will not pay Section 6: DCPD Coverage. The owner’s policy would pay for the damage to the automobile, because the owner’s policy always pays first and is considered the primary coverage for all vehicle damage claims.

If the at-fault motorist is not insured, damage to the not-at-fault motorist’s automobile can, in some cases, be claimed under Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage. If the uninsured motorist cannot be identified, the not-at-fault motorist may not be able to recover any money for their loss.

9.3.8.6.2 Section 6.4: How Much We Will Pay

9.3.8.6.2.1 Section 6.4.1: Determining Fault

Without Section 6: DCPD Coverage, and in tort provinces such as Alberta, the degree of fault apportioned to each driver in an accident is determined by the judge presiding over the lawsuit. In Ontario, the amount of fault apportioned is determined by the Fault Determination Rules within the Insurance Act Regulations.

If an insured disagrees with the degree of fault apportioned to them by the Fault Chart and the settlement presented by the insurer, they may sue their own insurer. The judge presiding over the case may alter the apportionment initially assigned by the Fault Determination Rules.

Regulation 668 contains the charts that insurers use to determine their insureds’ degree of fault in any given accident situation.

9.3.8.6.3 Section 6.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities

The conditions in Section 6.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities are very similar to Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. They are as follows:

• The insured must notify the insurer within seven days of the accident.

• The insured must protect the automobile from further damage, to the best of their ability.

• The insured must not make any repairs beyond those necessary to protect the vehicle further without the permission of the insurer, or until the insurer has had time to inspect the vehicle.

• The insurer must be allowed to copy all legal documents pertaining to the accident.

• The insurer must be allowed to inspect the vehicle at any reasonable time.

• The insured must submit a proof of loss within 90 days.

• The insured cannot abandon the wreckage of the automobile into the care of the insurer unless the insurer has made settlement of the claim for the full actual cash value of the vehicle. At that point, the insurer owns the salvage.

9.3.8.7 Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional)

Loss or damage coverage, sometimes referred to as “physical damage coverage,” indemnifies the registered owner of a described automobile for loss of or damage to the insured automobile and its equipment only. Coverage is divided into four separate sections. While insureds are not obligated to purchase any of these coverages, they provide financial protection for the value of the vehicle in the event of a loss.

While these coverages are part of the standard policy, they do not apply to any described automobile insured by the policy unless a premium is shown for them, or the policy states they are being provided at no cost on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.

Since September 1, 2010, if an insured is involved in an accident and is deemed to be 25% or less at fault, the accident cannot be used to increase premiums in the future.

All coverages within Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) are subject to a deductible.

9.3.8.7.1 Section 7.1: Introduction

9.3.8.7.1.1 Section 7.1.1: Coverage for Loss of or Damage to Your Automobile

Section 7.1.1: Coverage for Loss of or Damage to Your Automobile contains the following sentence:

“This Section applies only to the extent that a claim for damage to an automobile and its equipment would not be covered by Section 6, Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage of a motor vehicle liability policy.”

As we just learned, Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage (DCPD) Coverage pays for damage to the automobile when the insured is not at fault in an accident. If payment has been made for damage under Section 6: DCPD Coverage, no payment can be claimed under this section. Damage to the vehicle from almost any other cause can be claimed under one of these four sections of loss or damage coverage. As mentioned in Section 9.3.8.6, if a policyholder has added OPCF 49 and removed DCPD from their coverages, then this coverage is affected by relation. As you will learn, Sections 6 and 7 of the OAP 1 are intertwined, so if DCPD is not in effect, much of the collision and comprehensive coverages in Section 7 also do not respond to physical damage.

Since the insurer is paying for the restitution of damage to the insured automobile, the insurer reserves the right to inspect the automobile at all reasonable times. At the inception of a new policy, insurers often require an inspection of the vehicle before these coverages are granted. If the inspection request is not completed by the insured, coverages under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) may be removed from the policy, and claims under these sections may be denied.

9.3.8.7.1.2 Section 7.1.2: Coverage Options

9.3.8.7.1.2.1 Coverage A: Specified Perils

Coverage A: Specified Perils limits payments for damages to those caused directly by the following perils:

• Fire.

• Theft or attempted theft.

• Lightning.

• Windstorm.

• Hail or rising water.

• Earthquake.

• Explosion.

• Riot or civil disturbance.

• Falling or forced landing of aircraft or parts of aircraft.

• The stranding, sinking, burning, derailment or collision of any kind of transport in, or upon which a described automobile is being carried on, land or water.

9.3.8.7.1.2.2 Coverage B: Comprehensive

Coverage B: Comprehensive is an all-risks version of Coverage A: Specified Perils. It includes everything within Coverage A: Specified Perils, as well as the perils of falling or flying objects, missiles, and vandalism.

All damage to the vehicle not caused by a collision of some kind is covered under Coverage B: Comprehensive, unless specifically excluded.

9.3.8.7.1.2.3 Coverage C: Collision or Upset

Coverage C: Collision or Upset pays for all damage suffered when the insured automobile is involved in a collision with another object, or upset (tips over). Collision occurs when the vehicle hits something in contact with the ground. Upset damage occurs when the only thing the vehicle hits is the ground.

Note: Collisions with animals, such as deer or moose, are usually paid out under Coverage B: Comprehensive.

9.3.8.7.1.2.4 Coverage D: All Perils

This option combines the coverage of Coverage C: Collision or Upset and Coverage B: Comprehensive. The benefit to purchasing Coverage D: All Perils instead of separately purchasing Coverage C: Collision or Upset and Coverage B: Comprehensive is that Coverage D: All Perils includes two types of theft that are excluded under Coverage B: Comprehensive.

While Coverage B: Comprehensive excludes theft of the vehicle by a person who lives in the insured household, Coverage D: All Perils includes it. Coverage D: All Perils also includes theft of the vehicle by an employee who drives or uses, services, or repairs the described automobile. See Section 9.3.8.7.2.3: Section 7.2.3: Certain Thefts Not Covered for more information.

9.3.8.7.2 Section 7.2: Loss or Damage We Won’t Cover

9.3.8.7.2.1 Section 7.2.1: General

Since Coverage B: Comprehensive and Coverage D: All Perils are both all-risks policies, there are a number of exclusions applicable to these coverages.

The first three exclusions listed in Section 7.2.1: General are wear and tear exclusions:

1) Damage to tires.

2) Breakdown of any part of the automobile.

3) Any damage consisting of or caused by rusting, corrosion, wear and tear, freezing, or explosion within the engine.

The next two exclusions are types of theft claims that will not be honoured:

4) Damage resulting from an illegal claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement such as a mortgage or lease agreement. If the insured misses payments on their lease and the vehicle is repossessed, the insurer will not pay if the insured makes a theft claim for loss of the vehicle.

5) Loss or damage resulting from a change in ownership that is agreed to, even if that change was brought about by trickery or fraud. The policy provides an example of selling the car to a stranger at a party in exchange for a cheque. If the cheque bounces, the insured cannot claim the vehicle was stolen.

Additional exclusions include:

6) Damage caused by radioactive contamination.

7) Damage to contents of automobiles and trailers, other than their equipment. This section pays only for loss of or damage to the insured automobile. Equipment is defined as anything provided with the automobile or trailer to be used with the vehicle, and anything that is a permanent fixture in the automobile. For example, a scissor jack is not permanently attached to the automobile, but it would be considered equipment provided with the automobile for use with the automobile. Other examples include motorcycle helmets and child car seats.

8) Reimbursement for recorded material (CDs) is limited to $25. Only recorded material that was in the playing device at the time of loss is covered. Any recorded material in the vehicle’s storage cases or visor holders is considered contents of the automobile and is therefore not covered.

9.3.8.7.2.2 Section 7.2.2: Illegal Use

Insureds who engage in illegal uses of the automobile forfeit any claim for physical damage payable under the policy. The policy lists some very specific illegal uses and illegal activities which render Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) forfeit. They include:

• Any damage caused to the automobile while the insured was operating it while intoxicated.

• Damage caused for any action which also results in the insured being convicted of any of the following offences under the Criminal Code of Canada:

- Causing death by criminal negligence.

- Causing bodily harm by criminal negligence.

- Dangerous operation of a motor vehicle.

- Failure to stop at the scene of an accident.

- Operation of a motor vehicle when impaired or with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in the blood.

- Refusal to comply with the demand for a breath sample.

- Causing bodily harm during operation of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or a drug, or a combination of alcohol and a drug, or while the concentration of alcohol or drug in the operator’s blood exceeds the limit permitted by law.

- Operating a motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so.

- If the insured uses or allows the automobile to be used in a race or speed test, or for illegal activity.

- If the insured drives the automobile while not authorized by law.

- If another person, with the insured’s permission, drives or operates the automobile under any of these conditions.

9.3.8.7.2.3 Section 7.2.3: Certain Thefts Not Covered

As explained in Section 9.3.8.7.1.2.4: Coverage D: All Perils, the policy describes (1) the theft of the automobile by a member of the insured’s household and (2) the theft by an employee of the insured who drives or uses, repairs, or services the automobile. Both types of theft are excluded under Coverage A: Specified Perils and Coverage B: Comprehensive. However, Coverage D: All Perils is not subject to these two exclusions.

9.3.8.7.3 Section 7.3: The Deductible

We know that the deductible is the amount of any loss that the insured agrees to pay. The deductible amount is stated in the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. The standard deductibles in Ontario are currently $500 for Coverage C: Collision or Upset losses and $500 for Coverage A: Specified Perils or Coverage B: Comprehensive claims, as of June 1, 2016.

There are two types of losses not subject to the deductible under these coverages: fire losses and lightning losses. All other losses covered under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) are subject to the deductible. If the loss is caused by any insured peril other than fire or lightning, the insurer will pay the amount of the damage minus the deductible.

The policy lists a few examples of how Coverage C: Collision or Upset integrates with the Section 6: DCPD Coverage for payment of damages to the insured vehicle caused by a collision with another motorist.

Let’s revisit two examples from Section 9.3.8.6: Section 6: Direct Compensation – Property Damage Coverage. We’ll now apply Coverage C: Collision or Upset to those earlier situations. We will assume the standard $500 deductible also applies to the Section 6: DCPD Coverage for these two examples.

Here’s the first example:

Alexei was sitting in his car, stopped at a red light when he was struck from behind by Randy. In this case, Randy is considered to be 100% at fault for the accident, so Alexei is considered to be 100% not at fault for the accident.

Alexei’s automobile suffers $5,000 damage due to the accident. Alexei’s insurer will pay for the cost of repairs (less the $500 deductible) and temporary replacement transportation (for example, rental cars or taxis, buses, etc.) under Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

Randy, who is 100% at fault for the accident, would claim for the damage to his vehicle under his optional Coverage C: Collision or Upset. Assuming the damage to Randy’s car is $3,000, he would receive $2,500 from his insurer after the deductible was subtracted from the amount payable. Unlike Alexei, Randy will not be reimbursed for a temporary transportation replacement while his automobile is being repaired; there is no provision for such coverage in Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional). If Randy had purchased a separate endorsement (OPCF 20: Coverage for Transportation Replacement), he may be entitled to the coverage, but he would have had to purchase the coverage before the accident took place.

Here’s the second example:

Jamal and Angela are involved in a collision for which they are both considered to be 50% at fault. Jamal’s vehicle suffers $4,000 damage. His insurer, under Section 6: DCPD Coverage, will pay only for the portion of the damage which he is not at fault for. He is 50% at fault, which means he is 50% not at fault. Jamal’s Section 6: DCPD Coverage will pay for 50% of the $4,000 damage ($2,000). His insurer will then deduct from that amount 50% of the Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible. (Since the payment of the loss is partial in this case, the application of the deductible matches the percentage of the payment.) 50% of the $500 deductible is $250. Therefore, $250 is deducted from the $2,000 payment. Jamal will receive $1,750 from his Section 6: DCPD Coverage.

Then, he will claim the damage for which he is at fault from Coverage C: Collision or Upset. The mathematics will work the same: 50% of the damage is covered under Coverage C: Collision or Upset, so 50% of the deductible will apply. The payment will be $2,000 minus $250 ($1,750). This means that, in total, for the $4,000 loss, Jamal will recover $3,500 from his insurer.

We can use the same rationale to determine how much Angela will receive from her insurer under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage and Coverage C: Collision or Upset. She was determined to be 50% at fault, and 50% not at fault, for the accident. If Angela suffers $2,600 damage to her vehicle, her insurer will pay $1,300 minus 50% of the $500 Section 6: DCPD Coverage deductible ($250) for a total of $1,050 under her Section 6: DCPD Coverage. If she then claims the damage for which she is at fault from Coverage C: Collision or Upset, her insurer would pay $1,300 minus 50% of the $500 collision deductible ($250), for a total of $1,050 under her collision coverage. That means that, in total, for the $2,600 loss, Angela will recover $2,100 from her insurer.

If the Section 6: DCPD Coverage and Coverage C: Collision or Upset deductibles are the same, the insured will always pay the same deductible amount for any percentage of fault in a collision.

9.3.8.7.4 Section 7.4: Additional Benefits

The additional benefits below are coverages for indirect financial losses suffered concurrently with the damage to an automobile. The policy covers four such losses.

9.3.8.7.4.1 Section 7.4.1: Payment of Charges

9.3.8.7.4.1.1 General Average Charges

General average charges occur as a result of marine law. If a boat begins to sink while on route from one port to another, the captain of the boat will order the cargo on board to be jettisoned to reduce the weight of the boat and slow the sinking. However, in many instances, not all the cargo needs to be jettisoned — it is the sacrifice of a small portion that ensures the well-being of the majority of the shipment. Marine law states that all owners of cargo which is saved from the loss must share in the compensation of those owners whose cargo was thrown overboard. The cost of the lost cargo is divided between all owners of the cargo which survived. The assessed portion of damage each cargo owner must pay is referred to as a “general average charge.”

If an insured’s vehicle is on a ferry boat that starts to sink, the cars at the back of the ferry will be jettisoned to reduce weight. When the ferry lands, all owners of automobiles not jettisoned will be required to pay a fair portion of the cost to replace the vehicles jettisoned. The OAP 1 covers these general average charges.

9.3.8.7.4.1.2 Salvage Charges

The policy requires the insured to take all reasonable steps necessary to protect the automobile from further damage following an insured loss. While no repairs may be made without the express consent of the insurer, an allowance is made for repairs necessary to reduce further or continuing damage. Any expenses incurred by the insured to protect the vehicle from further damage will be reimbursed by the insurer. Necessary towing charges are also reimbursed under this provision.

9.3.8.7.4.1.3 Fire Department Charges

If the vehicle catches fire and the fire department is called to extinguish it, the fire department will bill the insured for their services. The insurer will pay the fire department charges on behalf of the insured.

9.3.8.7.4.1.4 Customs Duties

If an insured is vacationing in the United States and is involved in an accident (for example, damaging their fender), Coverage C: Collision or Upset will respond to the damage repair costs to install a replacement. When returning to Canada, the insured is technically importing a new fender. The insurer will pay the import duties on any new parts necessary for the repairs.

9.3.8.7.4.2 Section 7.4.2: Foregoing Our Right to Recover

The insurer waives its right of subrogation against a party responsible for damage to the insured vehicle if the party responsible was given permission by the insured to use the described automobile. However, there are two notable exceptions to this rule:

1) If the person responsible for the damage is in the business of parking, servicing, or selling automobiles. These individuals are bailees to whom insureds have entrusted their vehicle, and they have a legal responsibility to return the vehicle to the insured in the same or better condition as it was presented to them. These individuals have their own policy to cover automobiles of their customers.

2) If the person permitted to use the automobile uses it for any of the excluded uses or criminal activities prohibited by the policy. If the insured’s friend takes the car and is involved in an accident during its regular use, the insurer will pay for the loss and not subrogate. If the insured’s friend damages the automobile while engaged in a speed test or race, any loss paid out by the insurer will be recovered from the insured’s friend.

9.3.8.7.4.3 Section 7.4.3: Temporary Substitute Automobiles Covered

We learned about temporary substitute automobiles (TSAs) in Section 9.3.8.2.2.2: Section 2.2.2: Temporary Substitute Automobile. TSAs are automobiles not owned by the insured, or anyone else in the insured’s dwelling, that the insured is using while their own automobile is unusable due to its breakdown, theft, repair, servicing, sale, or destruction.

Coverage for physical damage to the TSA will be provided by the TSA owner’s insurance policy if they have purchased Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional). If the owner of the TSA has not purchased this coverage, and the insured is legally liable for the damage to the TSA, then the policy will pay for the damage, less the applicable deductible. The liability for the damage must be imposed by law or agreed to by the insured under contract.

If the owner of the TSA has coverage under their own policy, but their deductible is higher than the deductible on the insured’s policy, then the policy will pay for the difference between the deductibles. Technically, the insurer is paying the deductible amount on the TSA owner’s policy, as that sum represents an amount of loss suffered which is not covered anywhere else. The insurer pays all claims less the deductible showing on the insured’s policy, so the final amount is the difference between the deductibles.

Let’s look at an example.

Kenji’s Toyota Corolla has Coverage C: Collision and Upset with a $500 deductible and Coverage B: Comprehensive with a $500 deductible. His automobile is at the dealership for a lengthy service, so he borrows Alma’s Tesla to get to and from work for the day.

Alma’s car is much more expensive than Kenji’s and, although it also has Coverage C: Collision and Upset and Coverage B: Comprehensive, the deductibles on Alma’s policy are $5,000 and $1,000, respectively.

Kenji isn’t used to driving Alma’s car. He loses control of the vehicle and drives it into a tree on the side of the road, causing $10,000 of damage.

Since Alma has purchased Coverage C: Collision, her policy pays for the damage, less the $5,000 deductible. Since Alma has suffered a $5,000 loss, Kenji’s insurer will pay $5,000 toward the loss, less the deductible of $500 ($4,500).

9.3.8.7.4.4 Section 7.4.4: Loss of Use Due to Theft

If the described automobile is stolen, and the insured has purchased theft coverage (that is, Coverage A: Specified Perils, Coverage B: Comprehensive, or Coverage D: All Perils), the insurer will pay reasonable expenses for the rental of a similar substitute automobile or, if the insured chooses not to rent, pay reasonable expenses for taxis and/or public transportation instead. The maximum payable under this additional benefit is $900.

The payment of these expenses will not begin until 72 hours after the insured has reported the theft to the police or the insurer. The coverage will extend until the insured vehicle is repaired (if recovered) or replaced, or sooner if money is offered to settle the claim. As long as coverage was in place at the time of the theft, this coverage will continue until the claim is settled, even if the policy expires in the meantime.

9.3.8.7.5 SECTION 7.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities

The conditions under Section 7.5: Your and Other Insured Persons’ Responsibilities are very similar to Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. They are as follows:

• The insured must notify the insurer within seven days of the accident.

• The insured must protect the automobile from further damage, to the best of their ability.

• The insured must not make any repairs beyond those necessary to protect the vehicle further without the permission of the insurer, or until the insurer has had time to inspect the vehicle.

• The insurer must be allowed to copy all legal documents pertaining to the accident.

• The insurer must be allowed to inspect the vehicle at any reasonable time.

• The insured must submit a proof of loss within 90 days.

• The insured cannot abandon the wreckage of the automobile into the care of the insurer unless the insurer has made settlement of the claim for the full actual cash value of the vehicle. At that point, the insurer owns the salvage.

9.3.8.7.6 Section 7.6: Our Right to Repair, Replace, or Rebuild the Automobile

Section 7.6: Our Right to Repair, Replace, or Rebuild the Automobile is a plain language wording of Subsection (6) of Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. The insurer has the sole discretion to decide which form of indemnity will be used. If the insurer chooses to repair, replace, or rebuild the automobile instead of making a cash settlement for the loss, the insurer will notify the insured within seven days of the accident. Work will be completed within a reasonable time.

9.3.8.7.7 SECTION 7.7: What We Will Pay

An insurer’s maximum liability for loss or damage to an insured automobile is the ACV of the automobile at the time of the loss, less the deductible.

Note: Section 7.7: What We Will Pay mentions a $1,500 limit for after-market electronic accessories and equipment. Most people think of this limitation primarily as it relates to car audio equipment, but today’s automobiles can have devices ranging from GPS systems to infotainment modules installed after purchase. This stipulation is similar to the $25 limit on recorded material (see Section 9.3.8.7.2.1: Section 7.2.1: General).

9.3.8.8 Section 8: Statutory Conditions

We learned about the concept of Statutory Conditions in Chapter 5: Regulation of Insurance Contracts, as they relate to policies insuring for the peril of fire. Similarly, the OAP 1 Statutory Conditions outline the legal duties and responsibilities of each party to the contract and are binding on all parties. Insureds must be advised that when they breach Statutory Conditions applicable to them, they will normally lose their coverage.

The Statutory Conditions for automobile insurance policies are essentially the same for all provinces. However, some provincial variations exist. Ontario’s automobile Statutory Conditions include:

• Statutory Condition 1: Material Change in Risk.

• Statutory Condition 2: Incorrect Classification.

• Statutory Condition 3: Monthly Payments.

• Statutory Condition 4: Authority to Drive.

• Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property.

• Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile.

• Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit.

• Statutory Condition 8: Inspection of Automobile.

• Statutory Condition 9: Time and Manner of Payment of Insurance Money.

• Statutory Condition 10: Who May Give Notice and Proof of Claim.

• Statutory Condition 11: Termination.

• Statutory Condition 12: Notice.

• Statutory Condition 13: Statutory Accident Benefits Protected.

The Insurance Act requires that these conditions are printed in every automobile insurance policy in Ontario. While violation of any of the Statutory Conditions generally results in the denial of coverage, there are some exceptions. In its efforts to limit the right to sue, the government introduced legislative changes to ensure that certain accident benefits are available regardless of any violation of the Statutory Conditions. Refer to Section 31 of the SABS for details of the circumstances in which certain benefits are not payable.

Many of the Statutory Conditions are presented in plain language and have been incorporated into the OAP 1 sections we’ve learned about:

• Section 1.4: Your Responsibilities.

• Section 1.5: Where to Make a Claim and Who May Make It.

• Section 1.6: Our Rights and Responsibilities.

• Section 1.7: Cancelling Your Insurance.

Let’s look at each of the Statutory Conditions in more detail.

9.3.8.8.1 Statutory Condition 1: Material Change in Risk

Insureds must notify the insurer promptly, in writing, of any change within their knowledge that is material to the contract. The insurer must be advised of any change which occurs after the policy has been issued which serves to increase the chance for loss.

Other factors which may be material and are required to be reported to the insurer include:

• Change in insurable interest: If this change occurs without the actual transfer of the automobile, the insurer’s exposure may be increased. For example, if the automobile is given to a member of the insured’s family, the new owner and principal driver may represent a greater exposure to the insurer.

• Addition of mortgage or lien: If a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance affecting the automobile is made after the application has been completed, the insurer must be notified. If no notification is given, coverage for loss or damage to the automobile may be denied.

• Other insurance: When other insurance for physical damage is purchased during the policy period, the insurer must be advised. Insurers need to know about the potential for fraudulent losses when insureds purchase insurance from more than one insurer.

9.3.8.8.2 Statutory Condition 2: Incorrect Classification

If a client has been incorrectly rated, the insurer is required to make the necessary correction. This may require refunding any excess premium and paying interest at the bank rate on the overpayment.

If a correction requires additional premium to be paid, it must be requested within 60 days after the contract is made. No interest is charged.

9.3.8.8.3 Statutory Condition 3: Monthly Payments

This condition allows the client to pay the premium in equal monthly installments. The interest rate is in accordance with the Regulations in the Insurance Act.

9.3.8.8.4 Statutory Condition 4: Authority to Drive

The insured will not drive or operate the automobile unless they are authorized by law to drive or operate it. This requirement also applies to anyone else that the insured may permit to drive.

To be authorized, the driver must have a valid license. Additionally, failure to renew the license may invalidate the coverages.

The insured is prohibited to use or permit the vehicle to be used in the following situations:

• Races or speed tests.

• Any illicit or prohibited trades or professions.

9.3.8.8.5 Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property

Let’s examine the subsections of Statutory Condition 5 in detail.

“(1) The insured shall:

(a) give to the insurer written notice, with all available particulars, of any accident involving loss or damage to persons or property and of any claim made on account of the incident;”

The OAP defines “notice” in Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit. The written notice specified here must be delivered within seven days of the incident, provided the insured is able to do so. If the insured is unable to provide this notice due to incapacity or injury, the insured must provide this notice as soon as possible thereafter. The requirement for notice is important because the failure to provide such notice could result in a loss of coverage.

The courts have ruled that the obligation for notice depends on the circumstances of the loss. For example, in accidents involving serious bodily injury or property damage to others, it is expected that the insurer will be advised immediately. On the other hand, more time would be permitted to report an accident with more minor (or less invasive) damage, like running over a neighbour’s bicycle left on the insured’s driveway.”

(b) verify by statutory declaration, if required by the insurer, that the claim arose out of the use or operation of the automobile and that the person operating or responsible for the operation of the automobile at the time of the accident is a person insured under this contract; and

(c) forward immediately to the insurer every letter, document, advice or statement of claim received by the insured from or on behalf of the claimant.”

The insurer has both a right and a duty to defend the insured in any legal action. When it is clear that the other party involved in the accident is contemplating or has initiated legal action against the insured, copies of all legal documents received by the insured must be forwarded immediately to the insurer.

“(2) The insured shall not:

(a) voluntarily assume any liability or settle any claim except at the insured’s own cost; or…”

Insureds must be advised that any voluntary assumption of liability, or efforts they take to settle any claim on their own, may impair the ability of the insurer to provide a proper defence.

The right to investigate, defend, and settle claims rests with the insurer and not the insured. Accordingly, any obligations or costs incurred without the consent of the insurer are not recoverable under the policy.

“(b) Interfere in any negotiations for settlement or in any legal proceeding.”

As the insured’s irrevocable attorney, the insurer has full control over the settlement and defence of all claims against the insured. Under this Statutory Condition, the insured agrees not to interfere in those proceedings.

“(3) The insured shall, whenever requested by the insurer, aid in securing information and evidence and the attendance of any witness and shall co-operate with the insurer, except in a pecuniary way, in the defence of any action or proceeding or in the prosecution of any appeal.”

Insureds are required to assist the insurer in their defence. When requested to do so, these costs will be paid by the insurer.

9.3.8.8.6 Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to the Automobile

Statutory Requirement 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to the Automobile begins as follows:

“(1) Where loss of or damage to the automobile occurs, the insured shall, if the loss or damage is covered by this contract,

(a) give notice thereof in writing to the insurer with the fullest information obtainable at the time;

(b) at the expense of the insurer, and as far as reasonably possible, protect the automobile from further loss or damage; and”

This Statutory Condition contains the rules for claims involving loss or damage to the insured automobile. Specifically, the insured must take all reasonable steps to protect the automobile from further damage.

There are benefits to insurers when they pay these costs. For example, removing the automobile from the accident site will normally prevent theft, vandalism, and other losses which might otherwise occur if the automobile were left there.

Statutory Requirement 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to the Automobile also explains that the insured must provide the insurer with prompt written notice of any claim:

“(c) deliver to the insurer within ninety days after the date of the loss or damage a statutory declaration stating, to the best of the insured’s knowledge and belief, the place, time, cause and amount of the loss or damage, the interest of the insured and of all others therein, the encumbrances thereon, all other insurance, whether valid or not, covering the automobile and that the loss or damage did not occur directly or indirectly through any willful act or neglect of the insured.”

The insured must provide a proof of loss within 90 days of the date of the accident. If not, the insurer is not legally bound to honor the claim. In practice, most insurers will provide payment when a proof of loss is received after the allowable period, provided there is a reasonable explanation.

“(2) Any further loss or damage accruing to the automobile directly or indirectly from a failure to protect it as required under sub-condition (1) of this condition is not recoverable under this contract.”

When the insured fails to take reasonable steps to protect the automobile from loss, the insurer may deny payment on that portion of the damage which could have been prevented. For example, if the automobile is not removed from the accident site, theft and vandalism losses tend to occur.

Moving the vehicle could likely be within the insured’s ability, which means that any theft or vandalism losses could have reasonably been prevented. Therefore, those losses will not be paid by the insurer.

“(3) No repairs, other than those that are immediately necessary for the protection of the automobile from further loss or damage, shall be undertaken and no physical evidence of the loss or damage shall be removed:

(a) without the consent of the insurer; or

(b) until the insurer has had a reasonable time to make the examination for which provision is made in statutory condition 8.”

The insured is authorized to make repairs which are “immediately necessary” for the protection of the automobile. For example, the insured is authorized to replace a tire damaged in the accident to move the automobile to a safe location. In all other cases, repair cannot be undertaken without the insurer’s permission.

9.3.8.8.6.1 Examination of Insured

“(4) Insureds shall submit to examination under oath at such reasonable time and place as is designated by the insurer and shall produce all documents that relate to the matters in question and permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.”

This right is important if the insurer suspects the insured may be attempting to make a fraudulent claim or when the insurer is establishing the basis for the defence of a serious liability claim.

9.3.8.8.6.2 Insurer Liable for Cash Value of Automobile

Subsection (5) explains that the insurer will pay the loss or damage according to actual cash value, minus a deduction for depreciation. Factors considered in determining the amount of depreciation include:

• Exterior paint, trim, and condition.

• Mechanical condition.

• Mileage.

• Interior upholstery and trim.

• Equipment and accessories.

• Tires.

• Any other information that affects the automobile’s value.

The insurer’s liability for obsolete or out-of-stock parts is limited to the value of that part at the time of loss or damage, not exceeding the manufacturer’s latest list price.

9.3.8.8.6.3 Repairing, Rebuilding, or Replacing Property Damaged or Lost

Subsection (6) explains that the insurer may repair, rebuild, or replace the property damaged or lost (instead of making payment) if it gives written notice of its intention to do so within seven days after the receipt of the proof of loss. There is an exception to this Statutory Condition when an appraisal has been made.

The insurer always has the option of making settlement through repair or replacement instead of paying money. When the insurer elects to repair or replace, it must advise the insured no later than seven days after the insurer has received the proof of loss. If the insured has not received notice of the intentions of the insurer within that period, they are entitled to be paid on a cash settlement basis.

If the insurer decides to repair the automobile after an accident, the insurer may, but does not have to, use new parts provided by the original equipment manufacturer. It is important to note that the insurer has the right to use rebuilt or refurbished and non-original (after-market) parts, provided these parts are of a like kind and quality of the parts which they are to replace.

Most physical damage claims are settled without dispute. However, if the insured and insurer disagree on the nature and extent of the repairs and replacements required, their adequacy, or the amounts payable, the Insurance Act provides that these questions will be determined by appraisal. Either party may request that an appraisal be provided. Details about the appraisal process can be found in the Insurance Act.

9.3.8.8.6.4 No Abandonment; Salvage

“(7) There can be no abandonment of the automobile to the insurer without the insurer’s consent. If the insurer exercises the option to replace the automobile or pays the actual cash value of the automobile, the salvage, if any, shall vest in the insurer.”

Subsection (7) means that the ownership and responsibility for the automobile after a loss remains with the insured, even when it is apparent the loss is a total loss. When the automobile is replaced or the full actual cash value is paid by the insurer, the salvage is the property of the insurer. This prevents insureds from profiting from their loss. However, this does not prevent the insured from negotiating the purchase of the wreck as a part of the final settlement.

9.3.8.8.7 Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit

Statutory Condition 7: Time Limit requires the insured to send the notice referenced in Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property and Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile within seven days of the incident. If the insured is unable to provide notice within seven days because of incapacity (for example, if they are seriously injured in the accident), the notice must be given as soon as possible.

9.3.8.8.8 Statutory Condition 8: Inspection of Automobile

“The insured shall permit the insurer at all reasonable times to inspect the automobile and its equipment.”

The insurer has the right to inspect the automobile “at all reasonable times.” This allows the insurer to confirm that the automobile for which coverage is being claimed is one which is insured by the policy. Also, such inspection helps to verify the extent of the damage caused to the automobile.

9.3.8.8.9 Statutory Condition 9: Time and Manner of Payment of Insurance Money

Any payment that the insurer is liable for under the contract must be made within 60 days after receipt of the proof of loss, provided no appraisal has taken place. If an appraisal has taken place, the insurer is liable to make payment within 15 days of the appraisal. This allows the insurer a reasonable amount of time to investigate and process the claim. If the insurer refuses to pay the claim, it must promptly inform the insured in writing, stating the reasons for not paying the claim.

The insured may not commence an action against the insurer until they have complied with the requirements of Statutory Condition 5: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Persons or Property and Statutory Condition 6: Requirements Where Loss or Damage to Automobile. If an action is brought against the insurer, such action must be commenced either (1) within one year after the date of loss for recovery of loss or damage to the automobile or its contents or (2) within two years after the cause of action arose for loss or damage to persons or other property.

9.3.8.8.10 Statutory Condition 10: Who May Give Notice and Proofs of Claim

Notice and proofs of claim may be given and made by the agent of the insured if the insured is absent or unable to do so, providing the absence is satisfactorily accounted for. Alternatively, if the insured refuses to do so, a claim may be made by a person to whom any part of the insurance money is payable. There may be occasions when insureds are unable to give notice of loss or proof of loss; it would be unfair to deny them the right to collect under the contract if they are legitimately unable to do so. In such instances, a person appointed by the insured can act on their behalf. If the insureds refuse to file notice and proof of loss, a mortgagee or other party of interest is entitled to make a claim under the policy.

Statutory Condition 10: Who May Give Notice and Proofs of Claim also specifies that all amounts payable under the policy shall be reduced by the applicable deductible amount mentioned in the policy.

9.3.8.8.11 Statutory Condition 11: Termination

Statutory Condition 11: Termination differs from most other property/casualty policies because of the legislated “three strikes” rule for non-payment of premiums. Here’s how it works:

The insured may cancel the policy at any time, subject to a short rate return of any prepaid premium. If the insurer cancels for any reason other than non-payment of premiums, cancellation is subject to a 15-day notification period beginning the day after the day of mailing of the notification, which must be sent by registered mail. This notification period can be shortened to five days if the notice is personally hand delivered.

If there is a refund due to the insured, it will be issued on a pro rata basis and should accompany the cancellation notice. If it does not accompany the cancellation notice, the insurer should issue the refund as soon as possible thereafter. If the insured still owes any premium as of the cancellation date, the premium due must be shown on the cancellation notice.

The first two cancellations for non-payment of premiums in a policy term are subject to a 30-day notification period. This period begins the day after the day of mailing of the notification, which must be sent as registered mail. If the notification was hand delivered, then the period is 10 days. To prevent the cancellation from taking effect, the insured must pay the premium owing by noon of the business day before the cancellation date in the notification.

The third cancellation for non-payment in a policy term follows the same format as any other cancellation. Notice of 15 or five days is provided, depending on the notification method used by the insurer. There is no requirement for the insurer to reinstate the policy, even if premiums owed to them are paid prior to the cancellation effective date.

Cancellations are effective at 12:01 a.m. on the date specified, which means the insured has only one minute of coverage on the cancellation date.

9.3.8.8.12 Statutory Condition 12: Notice

“Any written notice to the insurer may be delivered at, or sent by registered mail to, the chief agency or head office of the insurer in the Province. Written notice may be given to the insured named in this contract by letter personally delivered to the insured or by registered mail addressed to the insured at the insured’s latest post office address as notified to the insurer. In this condition, the expression, ‘registered’ means registered in or outside Canada.”

Statutory Condition 12: Notice outlines the rules for communications between the insured and the insurer. If an insured fails to advise the insurer of a change in residences during the policy period, they may have their coverages terminated without being aware of the termination. This is because the insurer is required to address such notice only to the “latest post office as notified to the insurer.”

9.3.8.8.13 Statutory Condition 13: Statutory Accident Benefits Protected

Statutory Condition 13: Statutory Accident Benefits Protected allows for payments as set out in the SABS (outlined in Section 9.3.8.4: Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage), even if the insured fails to comply with the Statutory Conditions.

9.3.9 Conclusion

This brings us to the end of Part 2: The Owner’s Policy (OAP 1). You’ve learned not only what each OAP 1 section provides, but also numerous examples of how the coverages are put into action.

However, not every driver in Ontario fits perfectly into the OAP 1’s thoroughly designed mold. As a broker, it’s important for you to find ways to modify what the OAP 1 has standardized. Modifications to the OAP 1 are made through endorsements, otherwise known as Ontario Policy Change Forms. We’ll now turn our attention to these.

9.3.10 Ontario Policy Change Forms

Endorsements are used to make changes (that is, add or delete coverage) to insurance policies. The endorsements used to modify the OAP 1 are known as Ontario Policy Change Forms (OPCFs). Many endorsements have been standardized over time and, like the policy wording, have been written in plain language. The content of an endorsement may not be altered in any way.

We’ve outlined all the key OPCFs in the following section. However, you should refer to the actual endorsement for more details.

Also, note the formatting in some of these endorsements:

• We’ve underlined endorsements that are currently included within the OAP 1 wording.

• We’ve bolded the OPCFs that we believe are most important for your exam — but you’ll want to be familiar with all the OPCFs listed here.

If these look intimidating, don’t worry: it’s normal to need a bit of time to learn what each OPCF is and how it modifies the OAP 1. But they’ll serve you well when you’re serving your clients!

9.3.10.1 OPCF 2: Providing Coverage When Named Persons Drive Other Automobiles

OPCF 2: Providing Coverage When Named Persons Drive Other Automobiles extends the coverage in Section 2.2.3: Other Automobiles to persons named in the endorsement. Insureds can use this endorsement to prevent a shortfall in coverage, as OAP 1 limits these coverages specifically to the named insured and their spouse.

9.3.10.2 OPCF 3: Drive Government Automobiles

OPCF 3: Drive Government Automobiles provides coverage for a person driving a vehicle owned by the Government of Canada or any province or territory of Canada. Government vehicles are exempt from the mandatory insurance requirements.

9.3.10.3 OPCF 4A: Permission to Carry Explosives

OPCF 4A: Permission to Carry Explosives provides coverage to carry specified explosives. Normally, the OAP 1 specifically excludes coverage when the vehicle is used for such purposes.

9.3.10.4 OPCF 4B: Permission to Carry Radioactive Material

Similar to OPCF 4A: Permission to Carry Explosives, OPCF 4B: Permission to Carry Radioactive Material grants permission to carry specified radioactive material.

9.3.10.5 OPCF 5: Permission to Rent or Lease Automobiles and Extending Coverage to Specified Lessee(s)

OPCF 5: Permission to Rent or Lease Automobiles and Extending Coverage to Specified Lessee(s) provides coverage to the lessee as if the lessee were the named insured, and to every other person who uses or operates the automobile with the lessee’s consent.

This is a very important change to the policy wording; normally, only the registered owner should be the named insured. It is a lengthy endorsement that essentially changes all references within the policy from “you” to “the lessee.”

9.3.10.6 OPCF 5C: Permission to Rent or Lease

OPCF 5C: Permission to Rent or Lease gives the lessor permission to lease the automobile to the applicant. The insurer agrees to indemnify the lessee and every person who, with the lessee’s consent, drives the automobile. OPCF 5C: Permission to Rent or Lease is for short-term leases only: the automobile cannot be leased or rented for more than 30 days to any one person.

9.3.10.7 OPCF 5D: Conversion Coverage (Rented or Leased Automobiles)

OPCF 5D: Conversion Coverage (Rented or Leased Automobiles) is used for vehicles that are rented or leased. Remember, under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional), that the insurance company will not pay a claim resulting from a dishonest claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement except a lease.

9.3.10.8 OPCF 6A: Permission to Carry Paying Passengers

OPCF 6A: Permission to Carry Paying Passengers permits carrying passengers for compensation.

9.3.10.9 OPCF 6B: School Bus

OPCF 6B: School Bus permits carrying passengers for compensation for school purposes that would otherwise be excluded under Section 1.8.1: General Exclusion.

9.3.10.10 OPCF 6C: Public Passenger Vehicles

OPCF 6C: Public Passenger Vehicles permits carrying passengers for compensation or hire and sets out limits of liability that are available.

9.3.10.11 OPCF 6D: Driving Training School

OPCF 6D: Driving Training School permits carrying passengers for compensation or hire, but for driver training school purposes only.

9.3.10.12 OPCF 6F: Public Passenger Vehicles — Combined Limits

OPCF 6F: Public Passenger Vehicles — Combined Limits permits carrying passengers for compensation or hire only.

9.3.10.13 OPCF 7: Separate Limits

OPCF 7: Separate Limits separates and specifies the limits under Section 3: Liability Coverage.

9.3.10.14 OPCF 8: Property Damage Reimbursement

OPCF 8: Property Damage Reimbursement makes the insured responsible for part or all of any loss or damage to other people’s property covered under Section 3: Liability Coverage.

9.3.10.15 OPCF 9: Marine Use Excluded

OPCF 9: Marine Use Excluded excludes loss or damage occurring while the automobile is on or in water or during the launching or landing process.

9.3.10.16 OPCF 13C: Restricting Glass Coverage

OPCF 13C: Restricting Glass Coverage restricts the coverage for glass damage to losses caused by perils listed in the endorsement.

9.3.10.17 OPCF 16: Suspension of Coverage

OPCF 16: Suspension of Coverage suspends certain coverages for a specific period of time (for example, suspend coverage during the winter months if the vehicle will not be driven).

Note: You’ll want to know this one well, because you’ll often be asked about it!

9.3.10.18 OPCF 17: Reinstatement of Coverage

As the name implies, OPCF 17: Reinstatement of Coverage reverses the suspension of OPCF 16: Suspension of Coverage and restores coverage.

9.3.10.19 OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages

OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages specifies that the insurer shall not be liable under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) for any more than the actual cash value of the insured vehicle or the amount specified under this endorsement, whichever is less.

This endorsement could be used on high-value vehicles, vans, motor homes, ATVs, snowmobiles, etc.

Note: It’s important to learn the difference between OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages and OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles.

9.3.10.20 OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles

OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles is in reference to Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) and allows a described automobile to be insured on a valued basis. This could be used to insure classic, custom, or antique vehicles, etc.

Note: It’s important to learn the difference between OPCF 19: Limiting the Amount Paid for Loss or Damages and OPCF 19A: Agreed Value of Automobiles.

9.3.10.21 OPCF 20: Coverage for Transportation Replacement

OPCF 20: Coverage for Transportation Replacement expands on Section 7.4.4: Loss of Use Due to Theft and provides replacement transportation for any insured loss under Section 7: Loss or Damage Coverages (Optional) that exceeds the deductible amount for any one claim.

It reimburses the insured for reasonable expenses incurred because of the loss of use of the insured automobile. These expenses could include the rental of a substitute vehicle or the costs of taxis or public transportation. Coverage is limited in some cases to a stated amount per day and a maximum amount per occurrence. The limit of coverage can differ with each company.

9.3.10.22 OPCF 21A: Monthly Reporting Basis Fleet (Applicable to Ontario Licensed Automobiles)

OPCF 21A: Monthly Reporting Basis Fleet (Applicable to Ontario Licensed Automobiles) provides coverage for vehicles that are leased for a period of more than 30 days. Vehicles must be listed and statements of receipts or mileage (or other agreed means of rating) must be submitted to the insurer on a monthly basis.

9.3.10.23 OPCF 21B: Blanket Fleet Coverage for Ontario Licensed Automobiles

OPCF 21B: Blanket Fleet Coverage for Ontario Licensed Automobiles is used to insure automobile fleets and provides another method to identify what automobiles are covered.

9.3.10.24 OPCF 22: Damage to Property of Passengers

OPCF 22: Damage to Property of Passengers provides coverage to the property of passengers as if it belonged to the insured.

9.3.10.25 OPCF 23A: Lienholder Protection

OPCF 23A: Lienholder Protection provides protection for the lienholder’s interest in the insured vehicle. If there is a claim for loss or damage to the described automobile in which the lienholder has an interest, and the claim is settled in the form of a payment instead of a repair or replacement, the payment will be made jointly to the insured and the lienholder.

The lienholder is also protected through notification of any deletion of physical damage coverages or of any cancellation of the policy by the insurer.

9.3.10.26 OPCF 23B: Mortgage (Broad Form)

OPCF 23B: Mortgage (Broad Form) provides a greater measure of protection for the lienholder or mortgagee than OPCF 23A.

9.3.10.27 OPCF 24: Fire Apparatus

OPCF 24: Fire Apparatus eliminates the insurer’s liability for loss or damage to firefighting, salvage, or rescue equipment removed from the insured vehicle at the location of a fire.

9.3.10.28 OPCF 25A: Alteration

OPCF 25A: Alteration covers a wide variety of possible changes to the policy that are indicated in the appropriate spaces.

9.3.10.29 OPCF 27: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) and Providing Other Coverages When Insured Persons Drive Other Automobiles

OPCF 27: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) and Providing Other Coverages When Insured Persons Drive Other Automobiles extends coverage for damage to a non-owned automobile (including its equipment) resulting from the care, custody, or control of the non-owned automobile by an insured person and persons named in the endorsement (for example, a rental vehicle).

Note: It is important to understand the full coverage provided in this endorsement.

9.3.10.30 OPCF 27B: Business Operations — Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) in the Insured’s Care, Custody, or Control

OPCF 27B: Business Operations — Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobile(s) in the Insured’s Care, Custody, or Control is designed for commercial clients who have automobiles belonging to others in their care, custody, or control.

9.3.10.31 OPCF 28: Reducing Coverage for Named Persons

OPCF 28: Reducing Coverage for Named Persons reduces coverage, limits of liability, and loss or damage for specified named persons.

9.3.10.32 OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver

OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver allows for specific individuals to be excluded from coverage under the automobile policy, other than for certain accident benefits coverages. The excluded driver must sign this endorsement.

9.3.10.33 OPCF 29: Additional Coverage for Named Persons(s)

OPCF 29: Additional Coverage for Named Persons(s) extends coverage to allow specifically named person(s) to operate the insured vehicle.

9.3.10.34 OPCF 30: Removing Coverage for Attached Machinery

OPCF 30: Removing Coverage for Attached Machinery means an insurer will not be liable under Section 3: Liability Coverage and Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage for loss or damage arising out of the ownership, use, or operation of specified machinery, apparatus, or its equipment, mounted or attached to the automobile.

The insured may purchase a commercial general liability policy to cover this exposure.

9.3.10.35 OPCF 31: Non-Owned Equipment

OPCF 31: Non-Owned Equipment extends coverage to equipment not owned by the insured, but normally attached to the automobile.

9.3.10.36 OPCF 32: Use of Recreational Vehicles by Unlicensed Operators

OPCF 32: Use of Recreational Vehicles by Unlicensed Operators defines “recreational vehicles” as including snowmobiles, trail bikes, mini- automobiles, motor scooters, minicycles, snow planes, motorized toboggans, mopeds, and motor-assisted vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, dune buggies, or similar vehicles. It waives compliance with Statutory Condition 4(1) of the policy, which prohibits the insured, or anyone with the permission of the insured, from operating the insured vehicle unless authorized by law.

As a result, OPCF 32: Use of Recreational Vehicles by Unlicensed Operators would allow someone under the age of 16 to be insured while operating such a vehicle off a public highway.

9.3.10.37 OPCF 35: Coverage for Emergency Road Service

OPCF 35: Coverage for Emergency Road Service provides reimbursement for up to $50 for emergency services each time the insured vehicle is disabled.

9.3.10.38 OPCF 38: Agreed Limit for Automobile Electronic Accessories and Equipment

OPCF 38: Agreed Limit for Automobile Electronic Accessories and Equipment limits the amount the insurer will pay for loss or damage to automobile electronic accessories and equipment other than factory-installed equipment to agreed amounts. This came into effect January 1, 2001.

9.3.10.39 OPCF 40: Fire Deductible

OPCF 40: Fire Deductible makes losses caused by fire or theft of the entire automobile subject to a deductible, if they are not already subject to one. This endorsement is normally added to recreational vehicles.

9.3.10.40 OPCF 43: Removing Depreciation Deduction

OPCF 43: Removing Depreciation Deduction means that, in the event of loss or damage to the insured automobile by an insured peril, the insurer agrees not to deduct for depreciation. The amount payable is limited to the lesser of: (1) the actual purchase price of the vehicle and its equipment, (2) the manufacturer’s suggested list price at the time of original purchase, or (3) the cost to replace the automobile with a new automobile of the same make and model, similarly equipped.

The insured must be the original purchaser of the automobile.

9.3.10.41 OPCF 43A: Removing Depreciation Deduction for Specified Lessee(s)

OPCF 43A: Removing Depreciation Deduction for Specified Lessee(s) removes the insurer’s right to deduct depreciation when settling a claim for loss or damage similar to OPCF 43: Removing Depreciation Deduction.

9.3.10.42 OPCF 44R: Family Protection Endorsement

OPCF 44R: Family Protection Endorsement indemnifies an eligible claimant for the amount that they are legally entitled to recover from an inadequately insured or uninsured motorist as compensatory damages for bodily injury to or death of an insured person arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile.

This endorsement exists on almost every policy sold in Ontario. The minimum limit of liability coverage in the province is $200,000, but almost anyone with an insurance policy will have coverage for an amount greater than the minimum (either $500,000 or $1,000,000). The endorsement is designed to provide the same level of protection to the insured and their family as the insured has provided to the public at large, with the liability limit shown on the insured’s policy.

If the insured is struck by an underinsured motorist carrying only $200,000 liability coverage, and the insured’s policy provides coverage up to $1,000,000 for legal liability, OPCF 44R: Family Protection Endorsement could be used to pay up to $800,000 — the difference between the insured’s limit of liability and the limit of liability on the underinsured motorist’s policy.

If the insured suffers a threshold injury in the above-mentioned collision and sues the underinsured motorist for $600,000, the underinsured motorist’s policy will pay only $200,000. Without this endorsement, that would be all the insured could recover. With this endorsement on the policy, the insured would collect the remaining $400,000, as if it were the underinsured motorist’s liability policy.

This endorsement can be used to pay up to the difference between an underinsured motorist’s policy and the insured’s policy liability limits for any incident of a similar nature.

This endorsement will also top up the amount recoverable under these circumstances when only $200,000 is recoverable under Section 5: Uninsured Automobile Coverage, or if the absolute liability provision applies due to the illegal or prohibited actions of the at-fault motorist.

9.3.10.43 OPCF 46: Pre-determined Income from Self-Employment Agreement

OPCF 46: Pre-determined Income from Self-Employment Agreement allows the insured and insurer to come to a pre-arranged agreement on what the insured’s annual self-employment income will be for the purposes of determining accident benefits.

9.3.10.44 OPCF 47: Agreement Not to Rely on SABS Priority of Payment Rules

If a client purchases the mandatory coverages, the insurer is required to issue an OPCF 47: Agreement Not to Rely on SABS Priority of Payment Rules at no charge. This endorsement allows the insured to claim Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage (including optional benefits) provided by the policy, regardless of the priority of payment rules in Section 268 of the Insurance Act.

9.3.10.45 OPCF 48: Added Coverage to Offset Tort Deductibles

Under OPCF 48: Added Coverage to Offset Tort Deductibles, the insurer agrees to indemnify the insured for $10,000 for an insured person and $5,000 for a claimant under the Family Law Act for non-pecuniary claims (pain and suffering).

9.3.10.46 OPCF 49: Agreement Not to Recover for Loss or Damage from an Automobile Collision (for OAP 1)

This endorsement, added in 2024 by the Ontario Government, allows drivers who own their vehicle outright to opt out of the Direct Compensation for Property Damage (DCPD) coverage. If the described vehicle is damaged in a collision, the loss will not be compensated, even if they are not at fault. Owners will not be compensated by this insurance policy, or by anyone else, including anyone at fault for causing the damage, or their insurance company. In addition, there is no coverage under Subsection 7.1.2, C -- Collision or Upset, or 7.1.2, D -- All Perils with respect to the vehicle(s) listed on the form.

9.4.1 Facility Association

9.4.1.1 Overview

The Facility Association (FA) is an organization of Canadian insurers who co-operate to provide insurance for vehicle owners and/or drivers who, without this arrangement, would have difficulty obtaining insurance. Drivers that require the FA market typically have poor driving records (such as impaired driving convictions) or too many accidents or claims.

However, the FA has never issued a single insurance policy — that’s because it is not a licensed insurer. The existence of the FA allows individual insurers to avoid accepting undesirable business, while at the same time ensuring that legislated compulsory automobile insurance requirements are met by all drivers/vehicle owners. When individual insurers choose not to insure a risk, they provide the insurance at their collective cost through the FA. The FA is the administrator of this collective mechanism.

To understand how the FA works, it is necessary to understand how private/voluntary market insurers work differently from residual risk market insurers.

Voluntary market insurers have a whole array of insurance rates, which are linked to a whole array of underwriting criteria (for example, type of vehicle, type of use, geographic location, number of drivers, claims history, driving record, etc.). When someone needs automobile insurance, usually a broker (or agent) determines how the person fits into the array of underwriting criteria for the voluntary market insurers represented by the broker’s office.

If the applicant does not fit within the voluntary market underwriting criteria, they must still be provided with an insurance policy under the requirements of the Insurance Act. The broker then needs to look at residual risk market insurers, such as the FA.

The broker then determines how the driver fits into a separate array of FA rate categories and sends the application to an FA servicing carrier for a policy to be issued. That policy is essentially underwritten by all the insurers collectively. The broker collects the annual premium (or more likely, some portion thereof) and the servicing carrier issues a policy.

9.4.1.2 Organization Structure

The FA is an unincorporated association of property and casualty insurance companies. Since it is not a licensed insurance company, it does not have an insurance charter.

Because the FA is not an insurance company, it must contract members to underwrite insurance applications and to adjust claims. It appoints a limited number of members, known as servicing carriers, to conduct its business. The servicing carriers are paid a fee to perform this service, and they are expected to follow the rules of the FA as set out in its Plan of Operation and servicing carrier contract.

The servicing carrier must adjust claims in an efficient and practical manner following the claims guidelines. Certain underwriting expenses (for example, driver record abstracts) and certain claims expenses incurred by servicing carriers are reimbursed. The eligible expenses are laid out in the FA’s Plan of Operation and the Accounting and Statistical Manual.

Audits of each servicing carrier are conducted biannually to ensure proper compliance with FA rules, regulations, and procedures. These audits investigate the underwriting policy issuance operations and the claims operations of the servicing carriers.

The FA provides guidance to the servicing carriers on matters such as how to interpret the rules of the manuals. The servicing carriers also sit on several FA committees, such as its Rates and Rules Committee, Actuarial Committee, Claims Committee, and Accounting Committee, along with non-servicing carrier members.

The FA’s management prepares the organization’s financial statements. Its external auditors audit these statements.

The FA issues a monthly Participation Report to its members, who are required to enter the information into their books. There is no flow of any information (for example, underwriting, claims, financial, or system) from member companies that are not servicing carriers to the FA.

The FA has a limited relationship with brokers. Instead, a contract is set up between the FA, the servicing carrier, and the broker. Here’s how it works:

• The servicing carrier does all the administration.

• The broker contacts the servicing carrier if they need guidance with a policy. Occasionally, a broker may contact the FA if they want a change in servicing carrier, or if they do not agree with what a servicing carrier is stating — but normally, they rely on the servicing carriers for functions.

• The servicing carrier looks after the accounting functions, including paying the commissions or service fees to the brokers.

9.4.1.3 Policy Issuance and Claim Settlement

The FA sends blank insurance applications to the servicing carriers, who in turn send them to the brokers. Each application form is numbered in sequence, providing control in the distribution process. The FA is never involved with and does not receive completed applications, other than for auditing purposes.

The servicing carrier underwrites the applications, produces the documentation (policies), and distributes them directly to the brokers. The FA is not involved in policy processing and does not receive completed policies.

Servicing carriers, on behalf of the FA, also distribute the FA Manual of Rules and Rates to all brokers and agents. This manual provides detailed instructions and rules for determining how a risk is to be classified and how to calculate premiums, including what surcharges are to be applied. The Rates and Rules Committee, which consists of member company volunteers, develops the rules in the manual.

The rate portion of the manual contains the actual premiums by classification, vehicle type, industry limits and deductibles, and special surcharges and discounts. These rates are first developed by the FA’s consulting actuary, then reviewed by the Rates and Rules Committee, approved by the FA Board of Directors, and submitted to the appropriate provincial regulatory body for review and approval.

The servicing carrier makes claims payments on FA policies. Claims payments are made using FA cheques from the bank account set up by the FA for that carrier.

9.4.1.4 The Broker’s Role

After determining the client’s needs, the broker will survey the various insurance companies they represent to see if there is a market where they can place their client, at the best price and terms that can be negotiated with the insurer. (It’s worth noting that there may be some voluntary markets that may write a risk that others will not. Since no single broker represents all the companies in the marketplace, some brokers may have a market for a risk that others do not.)

If the broker cannot obtain a voluntary market insurer, then they will have no option but to place the insured through the FA. FA servicing carriers do not provide quotes, so the broker must complete the application, following the rules in the Manual of Rules and Rates. All brokers use the same manual. The manual is complex, which serves to ensure all insureds are treated fairly and consistently. Additionally, to qualify the applicant, the broker must include a rejection letter from a voluntary market insurer with the application. The application is then submitted to the broker’s designated servicing carrier.

In Ontario, there are rules and procedures for retention of business in the FA — that is, automatically removing risks that have improved and may qualify for the voluntary market. Outside Ontario, there are no such rules. Therefore, some risks that could get voluntary market coverage may stay in the FA if the broker does not check all its markets at renewal.

The FA commission rate is an incentive to remove risks. It is generally lower than the commission rate for the voluntary market, especially considering special commissions and bonuses that are offered in the voluntary market (for example, contingent profit commission). Furthermore, the FA does not offer any special commission to switch portfolios of business, nor does it offer any overriding commission to brokers for any special work they perform that would usually be completed by the insurer.

FA policies are more difficult to administer than voluntary market policies. The FA insists on signed and fully completed applications, including binder numbers and completion of a binder register. FA policies also require completion of additional forms for motorcycles, as well as commercial, garage, and public vehicles, which is more time consuming than handling voluntary market business — and all at a lower commission rate than the voluntary market.

9.4.2 Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario

As you’ll remember from Section 3.2.2: Provincial Supervision, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) protects the interests of consumers and pension plan members. It enforces sound business practices while encouraging a strong, competitive industry.

The FSRA is the Ontario government regulator of insurance companies, pensions, credit unions, Caisses Populaires, co-operatives, loan and trust companies, insurance agents and adjusters, and mortgage brokers. Its activities are as follows:

• Consumer complaints resolution.

• Automobile insurance driver profiles and rates review.

• Automobile insurance accident benefits dispute resolution.

• Mediation.

• Arbitration.

• Pension plans.

• Licensing.

• Regulation and enforcement.

• Financial Services Tribunal.

Let’s take a look at the FSRA activities that relate to automobile insurance.

9.4.2.1 Consumer Complaints Resolution

The FSRA’s Market Conduct Division offers consumers a last-stop forum to resolve complaints with insurance companies in Ontario. This department encourages insurance companies to resolve complaints directly with the consumer. If consumers are unable to resolve their complaint with the insurance company, the Market Conduct Division will assist consumers and make recommendations to the Superintendent of Financial Services if it appears that the insurer has engaged in unlawful business practices.

If a consumer has a complaint, the complaints process is as follows:

1) The consumer makes a complaint to the insurance company.

2) If the company is unable to resolve the complaint, the consumer will request a letter from the company stating its final position.

3) The consumer will write to the Market Conduct Division.

4) The Market Conduct Division will review the written complaint.

9.4.2.2 Driver Profiles and Rates Review

The FSRA monitors both the premium rates and driver classification systems used by insurance companies in Ontario. The insurance companies must file any proposed changes to their rates and driver classification systems for approval.

9.4.2.2.1 Credit Information

Credit information means information about a person’s creditworthiness. It includes information about, or derived in whole or in part from, the person’s credit score, including their credit-based insurance score, credit rating, occupation, previous places of residence, number of dependants, educational or professional qualifications, current or previous places of employment, estimated income, outstanding debt obligations, past debt payment history, cost of living obligations, and assets.

The list of unfair and deceptive acts or practices, as outlined in Regulation 7/00 of the Insurance Act, came into effect on September 1, 2010. Under this Regulation, Section 2(1)4 states that an insurer is prohibited to use credit information for any aspects of automobile insurance, including:

• Processing or responding to requests for a quotation.

• Processing or responding to requests for an application.

• Processing or responding to completed and signed applications.

• Processing offers to renew existing policies.

Insurers are also prohibited from using unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as defined in Regulation 7/00, to refuse or limit the amount in a statutory accident benefit claim.

9.4.2.3 Accident Benefits Dispute Resolution

The FSRA’s dispute resolution process helps consumers and insurance companies settle accident benefit claims.

9.4.2.4 Mediation

If there is a dispute over accident benefits, the parties must mediate their claim through the FSRA’s mediation department.

9.4.2.5 Arbitration

Arbitration is an alternative to court. It involves file review, pre-hearings, settlement discussions, and neutral discussions.

9.4.2.5.1 Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund

The law guarantees Ontario residents who are involved in an automobile accident the ability to make a claim to receive accident benefits or sue the at-fault driver for compensation. Individuals who are not protected by any automobile insurance policy can apply to receive accident benefits from the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (MVACF).

In addition, a lawsuit may be filed against the uninsured driver and owner of the at-fault vehicle. The MVACF provides accident benefits and liability limits of $200,000 plus some legal expenses. The MVACF will attempt to recover the amount paid out by the fund from the at-fault uninsured driver.

9.4.2.6 Licensing

The FSRA’s licensing department handles the licensing of agents, insurance companies, and mortgage brokers.

Note: The next four sections of this chapter involve the commercial use of vehicles. There will be more discussion on commercial auto in Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance.

9.4.3 OAP 2 (Driver’s Policy)

When an individual drives a vehicle belonging to another person and does not have an automobile insurance policy which could extend to provide the required coverage for borrowed vehicles, or when there is uncertainty whether the owner of the vehicle has insurance, the OAP 2 (known as Driver’s Policy) is available to provide coverage. However, since these circumstances are rare, there are relatively few OAP 2s issued.

An automobile is considered non-owned in the following situations:

• The insured is personally in control of the automobile as the driver or occupant in an automobile:

- Not owned by the driver.

- Not registered in the driver’s name.

• The automobile is not in operation by, but is in the personal care, custody, or control of the insured.

• An “automobile” includes a trailer. An automobile with a trailer is considered to be one vehicle under OAP 1, Section 1: Introduction, Section 2: What Automobiles Are Covered? and Section 4: Accident Benefits Coverage, and as separate vehicles under Section 3: Liability Coverage, including deductibles.

An OAP 2 may be purchased (probably in a residual risk market, such as the FA) by a driver who is excluded under OAP 1, OPCF 28A: Excluded Driver. OAP 2s are also frequently issued to facilitate filing proof of financial responsibility that the applicant may require to obtain a valid driver’s license.

The OAP 2 is organized in a similar manner to OAP 1. It contains the following:

• Section 1: Third Party Liability.

• Section 2: Accident Benefits.

• Section 3: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobiles.

• Section 4: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 5: General Provisions, Definitions and Exclusions.

• Section 6: Statutory Conditions.

The coverages under the OAP 2 match those of the OAP 1 except, of course, that the OAP 2 deals with coverages for vehicles not owned by the insured.

Note: Under OAP 2, Section 3: Liability for Damage to Non-Owned Automobiles of the Driver’s Policy, in order for Coverage A: Specified Perils, Coverage B: Comprehensive, Coverage C: Collision or Upset, or Coverage D: All Perils to apply, there must be liability imposed by law on the insured or liability assumed under an agreement for loss or damage to the non-owned automobile.

9.4.3.1 Rating

The insurer will need to know the full details of the type of vehicles likely to be driven and their type of use, as if liability for damage is assumed by agreement. The insurer will then rate the policy for the highest exposure.

The OAP 2 is purchased by businesses which operate or deal in the sale, repair, detailing, storage, parking, or servicing of automobiles in any fashion. The basic structure of the policy is very similar to the OAP 1. It is designed to cover the liability, accident benefits, uninsured automobile, and DCPD exposures of owners, active partners, and full-time employees when driving automobiles that are registered in the business’s name.

9.4.4 OAP 4 (Garage Policy)

The OAP 4, often referred to as the Garage Policy, is designed for businesses that operate clients’ vehicles. Despite its name, it is not only for automotive repair garages, but for any business that operates other people’s vehicles, such as hotels or restaurants with valet/concierge services.

In this section, we will refer to garages only to keep things simple. The major difference between the OAP 1 and the OAP 4 is the policies’ treatment of damage to automobiles. The OAP 4 is designed for businesses relating to automobiles. It provides coverage for both owned and non-owned automobiles for loss or damage that occurs while being operated by an owner, active partner, or full-time employee. Vehicles belonging to the business’s customers would be considered non-owned automobiles (more on this in Section 10.8: Commercial Automobile & the Sharing Economy).

A business is responsible for a customer’s vehicle while it is in the care, custody, and control of the business. The customer’s OAP 1 will not respond to damage caused by a garage employee, because this damage is specifically excluded under that policy (see Section 1.8.4: Garage Workers Not Covered). The non-owned automobile coverage available under the OAP 4 fills this gap.

The OAP 4 consists of the following sections:

• Section 1: Third Party Liability.

• Section 2: Accident Benefits.

• Section 3: Uninsured Automobile Coverage.

• Section 4: Direct Compensation – Property Damage.

• Section 5: Loss or Damage to Owned Automobiles.

• Section 6: Liability for Damage to a Customer’s Automobile While in the Care, Custody or Control of the insured.

• Section 7: General Provisions, Definitions and Exclusions.

• Section 8: Statutory Conditions.

9.4.5 Standard Policy Forms

Standard Policy Forms (SPFs) are legislated and administered by the Superintendent of Insurance to protect the insuring public. All provincially licensed insurance companies who issue automobile insurance in Ontario must use these approved forms (although their underwriting rules of acceptance and rating may be different).

Some of the most common Standard Policy Forms (SPFs) are described next.

9.4.5.1 SPF 6: Standard Non-Owned Automobile Policy

SPF 6: Standard Non-Owned Automobile Policy has been designed to meet the needs of employers who may be held responsible for damages caused by employees operating their own (or others’) vehicles in the course of regular business. The coverage is normally sold to anyone operating a business where there can be regular or occasional use of vehicles that the business does not own.

This policy covers the insured, who is the employer, as well as every partner, officer, or employee if they drive a non-owned automobile in the business of the employer on the policy. These persons are not covered if the automobile is owned by or licensed in the name of the insured, the person driving, or a resident of the dwelling premises of the insured or the driver.

Coverage applies to automobiles not owned by the insured. The automobiles may be owned by the employees, rented or leased by the insured, or operated under contract for the insured.

9.4.5.2 SPF 7: Excess Automobile Policy

SPF 7: Excess Automobile Policy is used in provinces with government-run automobile insurance policies. This is an extension policy to provide additional or excess coverage for liability and accident benefits, over and above the government’s primary insurance policy.

The government policy always pays first, and that coverage must be exhausted before SPF 7: Excess Automobile Policy will respond. This policy often provides coverage to pay the deductibles on the standard government policies for physical damage to the automobile.

9.4.5.3 SPF 8: Lessor’s Contingent Automobile Policy

SPF 8: Lessor’s Contingent Automobile Policy provides coverage on a contingency basis for businesses that lease vehicles on a long-term basis. Coverage is applied secondary to coverage already in place on the vehicle (which the lessee is responsible for purchasing).

If the lessee has not purchased the required insurance, or has somehow violated a policy condition and therefore forfeited the coverage, SPF 8: Lessor’s Contingent Automobile Policy will respond and pay the lessor their interest in the vehicle and/or its loss or damage.

9.5 CONCLUSION

You’ve reached the end of our chapter on automobile insurance in Ontario. Yes, it’s a lot of information to take in, but we are also not done with it just yet! In Chapter 10: Commercial Property Insurance, we will extend this discussion slightly by introducing how auto insurance works for commercial clients and those in the sharing economy.

Unfortunately, automobile accidents occur every day, and policies such as the OAP 1, OAP 2, and OAP 4 are necessarily long and complex to meet the needs of many different drivers. But remember: the information here is vital for you to know, both for the RIBO Level 1 exam and throughout your work in a brokerage. The next time you’re driving or riding in a car, you can think about Ontario’s simple, but also complex, automobile insurance structure.

10.1 INTRODUCTION

Commercial buildings in Canada come in every shape and size imaginable. Physically, the buildings can range from small-frame, historic brick buildings all the way to modern, multi-storey, multifunctional fire-resistive buildings — and everything in between. Commercial insurance is a vast topic, and it takes brokers years to gain the experience they need to competently advise clients about it — but this chapter will give you an overview of the considerations involved.

10.2 THE COMPLEXITY OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET

For our purposes, we’ll consider any building that is not a residential structure as a commercial risk. This means that we’ll be viewing condominiums and apartments as commercial structures as well (because although they are residential in occupancy, they have an operating/management company).

Image

The occupancy of these buildings is as varied as the buildings themselves. Business operations can differ vastly based on whether they produce a product or offer a service. They can be anything from simple (such as a single-person carpenter shop) to complex (such as a hospital or a large automotive manufacturing plant). Different types of business operations, and their different types of exposure, are also known as mercantile risks. The Canadian business landscape ranges from forestry, mining, fishing, and other primary industries to sophisticated bio-engineering companies doing cutting-edge genetic research. Additionally, each business has different types of protection available to it, such as public or private protection fire halls or central station alarm connections.

It’s natural to assume that densely populated urban locations come with greater risks, but smaller rural locations present just as many risk challenges as their larger urban counterparts. No matter where a building is, brokers need to conduct a thorough review of its location, occupancy, and operations to adequately determine its level of risk and, subsequently, its insurance requirements.

10.2.1 Small Risks vs. Large Risks

Just like property and automobile insurance, a lot has been done over the years to standardize and formalize the process of assessing the risks for businesses. Many insurance companies have created package policies that already include most of the coverages certain businesses need based on their industry.

Smaller risks (such as salons, convenience stores, or landscapers) often involve a limited number of exposures, so a package policy is often sufficient for these businesses. This is often the most cost effective method of providing insurance to businesses that have many common elements.

However, package policies are not a one-size-fits-all product. Some may allow additional limits or coverages to be incorporated, but overall, the scope of a package policy is not very broad. When working with commercial clients, make the effort to properly and realistically assess the business’s needs to find where gaps lie in the package policy. Then, ensure the policy is thoroughly reviewed and analyzed for every risk.

Larger, more complex risks require the broker to have a sound understanding of how each business operates, the nature of the products or services it offers, and the geographical reach of the business. These risks do not fit into the mold of a package policy, so they must be individually underwritten. Commercial insurance brokers selling individual policies need to have a far broader knowledge of both the client’s business operations and the insurance policy wordings. They’ll also gain a deeper understanding of different insurance companies’ underwriting appetites for certain classes of risk. Complex risks require complex solutions, and brokers need deep experience, training, and skill to properly provide the best coverage for these commercial clients. (See more about subscription policies in Chapter 2, Section 2.7.1)

For our purposes, a simple understanding of the two basic policy forms — the Named Perils Form and the Broad Form — will be sufficient to lay a foundation that you can build on later in your career. This chapter will introduce you to the complexity of this subject, but you’ll need further study and practical experience to become a competent commercial lines broker.

10.3 BASIC POLICY FORMS

The first step in the insurance process is to do a thorough survey of the insurance prospect. Most brokers conduct an interview-like process to ask key questions and record the client’s responses. All brokerages will have a commercial survey form (or similarly named questionnaire) containing the necessary questions to properly identify the risks presented by the client. Many of these questions will require some effort and evidence from both the broker and the client to determine the proper answers. For example, current valuations on building, stock, and equipment can take time to determine and may come from different sources.

Remember: it’s up to the insured — not the broker — to make the final determination of values. If a broker assumes or guesses at the policy limits on the client’s behalf, and the limits fall short in an actual claim, the broker will risk an errors and omissions (E&O) claim.

This process may seem very complicated compared to personal lines insurance. Personal property insurance has largely been reduced to algorithmic underwriting to create a computergenerated policy. In a Homeowner Policy, limits are set from the Home Evaluation Calculator, and all the limits and coverages follow from the one figure. Whether the insured has outbuildings or jewellery is irrelevant to the limits on the policy; a broker can add coverages, but they cannot delete the standard policy coverages. In personal lines insurance, only exceptions to the norm will require physical underwriting.

In contrast, a broker who is looking at a commercial insurance exposure needs to consider all the physical components of the risk. There are three main physical components to a risk:

1) Building.

2) Stock.

3) Equipment.

Let’s look at how these components are defined in the Commercial Property Broad Form (IBC 4037).

10.3.1 Building

Image

“‘Building’ means the building(s) described on the Declarations Page, including temporary locations and newly acquired locations, if they are to be covered by this form. These are defined as:

1. Fixed structures pertaining to the building and located on the premises.”

“Premises” are defined as the entire area within the property lines and areas under adjoining sidewalks and driveways. It includes erected pole signs, yard lights, and perimeter fencing constructed on the premises. Each structure must be noted on the declarations to be covered by the policy.

“2. Additions and extensions communicating and in contact with the building.

3. Permanent fittings and fixtures attached to and forming part of the building(s).”

The value of plumbing, heating, air conditioning, lighting fixtures, wall-to-wall carpeting, and other permanently installed equipment is included in this amount.

“4. Materials, equipment and supplies on the premises for the maintenance of, and the normal repairs and minor alterations of the building or for building services.”

Any material on site for new construction or major renovation would not be covered.

“5. Growing trees, plants, shrubs or flowers inside the building use for decorative purposes when the insured is the owner of the building.”

This applies to the owner of the building, because a tenant would not have an insurable interest in the building.

10.3.2 Stock

Image

“Stock” is defined as:

“1. Merchandise of every description usual to the insured’s business.”

The type of business in which the insured is engaged will usually be indicated on the declarations page. When a client purchases stock insurance, they receive coverage for all merchandise or items sold that are usual to that business. For example, If the insured’s business was described as a bookstore, but they submit a claim for bicycles sold by the shop, the insurer would have grounds to deny such a claim.

The rate and premium charged are based largely on the nature of the stock, because there is a wide variation in susceptibility to loss from one type of stock to another. For example, high-end bicycles have a higher potential for loss and would warrant a higher premium.

“2. Packing, wrapping and advertising materials.”

This includes all material used to distribute any of the merchandise sold. It includes advertising and promotional material, such as flyers and catalogues.

“3. Similar property belonging to others which the insured is under obligation to keep insured or for which the insured is obligated.”

Note that, under this definition, the property lost or damaged must be similar to that insured by the policy. This means that goods held on consignment must be similar to those stated on the declarations page.

The insured must have had an obligation to keep the property insured. The normal practice is to have a written agreement in place outlining the obligations of both parties.

Additionally, the insured must have been legally obligated either as a bailee or based on the standard of ordinary care. From an underwriting point of view, it is important to know the nature of all the stock in a building and how it relates to the insured’s business.

10.3.3 Equipment

Image

“Equipment” is defined as:

“1. Generally all contents usual to the Insured’s business, including furniture, furnishings, fittings, fixtures, machinery, tools, utensils and appliances other than ‘building and stock’.”

Equipment can include office furniture, fittings, and display cases, as well as machinery ranging from air compressors to forklifts.

“2. Similar property belonging to others which the insured is under obligation to keep insured or for which they are legally liable.”

You might remember this clause from the definition of “stock,” and the intention is identical. Many operations lease or rent equipment, such as photocopiers, computers, office furniture, and forklifts, so this definition includes those items. Brokers need to know not only what is owned, but also any lease agreements related to the business.

“3. Tenants improvements, which are defined as building improvements, alterations and betterments made at the expense of the Insured to a ‘building’ occupied by the insured and which are not otherwise insured provided the Insured is not the owner of the building.”

Renting space in multi-use buildings — such as malls or high-rise buildings — is very cost effective for many insureds. The space is often unfinished and the tenant/insured finishes the space to their own specifications. These tenant improvements and betterments are normally left in the building when they leave. Because the tenant has no interest in the building, but they paid for these improvements and betterments, these tenant improvements must be insured as equipment on the tenant’s policy.

If the insured purchases the use interest on tenant improvements made by the previous tenant, this form applies as though the tenant improvements had been made at the expense of the insured.

Once the broker has identified these components and given the appropriate values by the insured, the broker can then analyze the risk exposure each component presents. However, there may be challenges to ensuring adequate limits are met. To ensure adequacy of limit we apply the co-insurance clause with a co-insurance factor dependent on the type of building, operation and products (discussed in Section 10.3.5). Once all these parts are determined, we can then look at the type of policy required to meet the insured’s requirements and expectations.

10.3.4 Determining Insurance Values

Remember: the onus is upon the insured — not the broker — to establish the amount of insurance required and to prove the amount of any loss (per Statutory Condition 6: Requirements After Loss). The broker’s role is to provide the advice, guidance, and direction the insured needs to meet those obligations. A major part of the broker’s role is ensuring that the insureds know the level of property values required for insurance purposes and guiding them towards insuring to those levels. Brokers are not property appraisers, but they can assist the insured in completing standard industry forms. Established appraisal firms or local building contractors with relevant experience can also help in determining building valuations.

There are various ways of determining value, but for our purposes, we’ll limit ourselves to two options: actual cash value (ACV) and replacement cost (RC). The traditional meaning of ACV is the cost to repair or replace lost or damaged property, less the application of any depreciation. In other words, it’s today’s price, less depreciation. RC represents the costs to repair, replace, or rebuild the lost or damaged property, without deduction for depreciation. Insuring a building on an RC basis usually requires a proper appraisal.

Stock is insured on ACV basis, whereas equipment can be insured on either. Again, the onus is on the insured to provide the proper data to ensure adequate limits in case of loss. These limits can be determined from invoices and inventory figures, and they are probably easier to determine than building values. (This is particularly true for older buildings, whose valuations can be more subjective.)

When the stock limit is consistent throughout the year, one limit is shown on the policy. There are some businesses where the limit fluctuates throughout the year and there are clearly defined peak months with a significant increase in value. Those retailers catering to the seasonal holiday market (for example, New Year, Christmas, and Diwali) would have a large increase in the months prior to the that holiday period. Inventories plunge after that period and are restocked again over the year. The peak season endorsement allows pre-determined increases in stock limits so the insured is not paying for unnecessary coverage during the down times.

Package policies catering to these types of businesses include an automatic increase (for example, 25% during the stated period) without making an actual endorsement to the policy. Those who do not have a package policy, such as a manufacturing operation, would be required to make an annual valuation of stock to make sure there is adequate coverage.32

10.3.5 Co-insurance Clause

Below is an example of a co-insurance clause:

“This clause applies separately to each item for which a co-insurance percentage is specified on the Declarations page and only where the total loss exceeds the lesser of 2% of the applicable amount of insurance or $5000.

The insured shall maintain insurance concurrent with this form on the property insured to the extent of at least the co-insurance percentage specified on the Declarations page of the Actual Cash Value (ACV) thereof and failing to do so, shall only be entitled to recover that portion of loss that the amount of insurance in force at the time of loss bears to the amount of insurance required to be maintained by this clause.”

In commercial property, the insurer will normally require the insured to purchase an amount of insurance which, as a minimum, is equivalent to a predetermined percentage of the property’s value (usually 80% or 90%). When the amount of insurance purchased is less than this amount, the insured will be required to share in any future loss (that is, pay themselves). The formula used to determine the amount of the loss to be borne by the insured is included in the policy’s co-insurance clause.

The co-insurance clause exists because many people will deliberately under-insure to reduce the amount of premium they pay. Others may be careless in their estimate of current values and end up woefully under-insured. In other cases, they are expecting to suffer only a partial loss, so they base their purchasing decisions on that expectation. However, in the event of a total loss, insureds often expect full payment for partial losses — even if they failed to pay sufficient premium to cover the whole property.

The co-insurance clause prevents this from happening. In the event of a total loss, the payout to the insured is limited by the policy limit purchased. This means that, if the insured is underinsured, they would suffer a financial loss to the amount they are under-insured for. In the event of a partial loss, they would also be penalized by only receiving payment based on the formula which determines that shortfall.

Confused? Let’s look at an example.

John insures his $1,000,000 commercial property for $10,000. If his property is totally destroyed, should he expect his insurance to pay for $1,000,000 or $10,000?

It makes little sense to pay 100% of all losses when the amount of insurance purchased is significantly less than the total value of the property.

Sandy owns the unit next to John. Her commercial property is valued at and insured for $1,000,000. If she suffers the same loss as John, should she expect her policy to help pay for John’s loss?

It is unfair to ask other insureds who purchase the required amount of insurance to subsidize those who do not.

10.3.5.1 The Formula

Co-insurance uses a straightforward formula to determine the proper amount of coverage for a business (including building, stock, and equipment).

Did ÷ Should × Amount of the Loss = Settlement

In the equation above, Did is the amount of insurance purchased, and Should is the percentage of insurance required (80% or 90%) × actual cash value (ACV).

Consider this example:

Antonia owns a building with an ACV of $300,000, but she purchased an insurance policy with a limit of only $150,000. The policy included an 80% co-insurance clause. Antonia then suffered a $30,000 loss.

Let’s calculate Antonia’s amount payable:

Image
Did 	÷ 	Should 	= 		× 	Loss
$150,000 		$240,000 		0.625 		$30,000
	Amount Paid 	$18,750

Under her co-insurance clause, Antonia would receive only $18,750. This means she would become a “co-insurer” in the loss and would pay a penalty of $11,250 because she failed to purchase adequate limits on her policy.

The co-insurance would be waived if the claim was less than 2% of the applicable amount of insurance, or $5,000. This facilitates the adjustment of small claims.

In the event of a loss, the insurer will make payment based on the lowest of:

• The amount calculated using the co-insurance formula.

• The limit of insurance.

• The amount of the loss.

10.3.5.2 Deductible Clause

When a loss is subject to a co-insurance penalty, the amount of the loss is calculated first, followed by the amount of the deductible. In the example above, the insurer would first calculate the loss of $18,750 and then apply the appropriate deductible. If that deductible was $1,000, the net payment to Antonia would be $17,750.

10.3.6 Risk Analysis

The risk factor that each insured presents is based on both their location’s physical and operational factors. Where a building is located, the protection afforded to it, and the type and value of its contents (stock and equipment) all have a bearing on the determination of rate and subsequently the premium.

The acronym COPE (which stands for Construction, Occupancy, Protection, and Exposure) can be used to describe the physical state of a risk:

1) Construction.

• Masonry and fire-resistive buildings that use modern building materials make a risk more attractive than a frame structure.

• The age of the building impacts the viability of its mechanical components and has a direct relation on whether a building meets modern building and fire codes.

2) Occupancy.

• The occupancy of the building by both the insured and others will affect the fire rate.

• In multi-occupancy buildings, the occupant with the highest exposure will affect the rate of all the building occupants.

• The type of contents (either raw or finished products) and the manufacturing process to produce those items directly affects the rate. For example, an insurance broker’s office would generate a rate well below a plastic parts manufacturer with highly flammable stock.

3) Protection.

• The availability and type of fire protection has a direct effect on the rate. Public protection includes the distance from fire hydrants (which determines water supply) and the number of local professional full-time fire stations (which determines response time). Private protection includes the internal activities of the building to prevent or reduce loss (such as sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and properly installed and monitored central station fire detection systems). These protections will reduce the rate for a risk.

4) Exposure.

Location

• Primarily, the exposure is tied to the physical location, such as what is located to the left, right, front and back of a risk. The physical location has a direct effect on the rate. The distance from other buildings, the construction of neighbouring buildings, and the character of the neighbourhood all impact the rate.

Claims History

• Additionally, the insurer will review the claims history of the insured and of similar businesses over a period of time (for example, the previous five years) to determine both the frequency and average severity of losses. Even though a loss is an unforeseen event in the future, the past history of both the insured and the industry is a pretty good indication of the likelihood of loss.

10.3.7 Policy Forms

Next, we will discuss two policy forms — the Named Perils Form and the Broad Form — that are used to provide coverage after the risk has been properly surveyed and the limits and risk exposure have been determined.

10.3.7.1 Named Perils Form (IBC 4036)

The Named Perils Form (IBC 4036) is a very basic form that provides limited coverage for a risk. It can be used for difficult risks or for risks that require only limited coverages.

The Named Perils Form provides coverage for:

• Fire.

• Lightning, including loss or damage to electrical devices.

• Explosion (limited).

• Impact by aircraft, spacecraft, or land vehicles.

• Riot, vandalism, or malicious acts.

• Smoke due to a sudden, unusual, and faulty operation of any stationary furnace.

• Leakage from fire protective equipment.

• Windstorm or hail.

This commercial Named Perils Form is comparable to a specified perils policy in habitational insurance. For a claim to be paid, the loss has to be caused by one of the insured perils.

10.3.7.2 Broad Form (IBC 4037)

The Broad Form (IBC 4037) insures against all risks of physical loss or damage, subject to policy limits and exclusions. It is comparable to a comprehensive policy in habitational insurance.

Note that there is a Broad Form Homeowner Policy which provides all-risks coverage on the building and named perils on the contents. However, in commercial insurance, a Broad Form is entirely all-risks, so the loss is insured unless a specific exclusion in the policy says it is not. When you hear the term “Broad Form,” it’s important to be clear whether it’s a personal or commercial policy.

Even the term “all-risks” is a misnomer. It would be rare to find an insurance policy which insures against all losses without exception. All policies contain exclusions for both property and perils insured, as well as a number of miscellaneous conditions. Insureds need to be reminded that even the broadest coverage forms have limitations in what they insure.

Earlier in this chapter, we learned the definition of property, what it includes, and what needs to be identified on the declarations page. Now, we’ll examine the specific property and perils that are excluded under the Broad Form.

Examples of excluded property include:

• Sewers, drains, and watermains located beyond the outside bearing walls.

• Street clocks and exterior signs.

• Animals, birds, and fish.

• Money, platinum, cash cards, evidence of debt or title.

• Automobiles, watercraft, aircraft (but not unlicensed automobiles or unlicensed trailers) used on the insured premises while on the insured’s business.

• Property in the custody of sales representatives outside the premises, unless an amount is shown on the declarations page for the sales representative.

• Any pressure vessel having a working pressure greater than 103 kilopascals.

• Any boiler, including its connecting pipe and equipment, containing steam or water under steam pressure.

Examples of excluded perils include:

• Earthquake.

• Flood.

• Seepage and leakage.

• Backup or overflow of water from sewers, sumps, septic tanks, and drains.

• The entrance of rain, sleet, or snow through doors, windows, skylights, or other openings.

• Centrifugal force, mechanical, or electrical breakdown.

• Failure to control temperature or humidity.

• Trade losses.

• Pollution and contamination.

Neither of these lists are exhaustive, so be sure to consult the Broad Form wording for other exclusions.

10.3.7.3 Common Clauses

Below are some of the common clauses attached to all policies, excerpted from the Broad Form.

10.3.7.3.1 Debris Removal Clause

“The insurer will indemnify the insured for expenses incurred in the removal of debris of the property insured occasioned by loss or damage to such property, for which loss or damage insurance is afforded under this form.”

Insurance is intended to repair, rebuild, or replace property after a loss. However, when there is a significant loss, insureds will also incur additional expense in removing the debris from the premises. If the limits of insurance have not been fully used to pay for damage insured by the policy, the insurer agrees to allow insureds to use any remaining amounts to pay for debris removal.

This coverage is not provided when all limits are used up to pay for a claim.

10.3.7.3.2 Reinstatement Clause

“Loss under any items on this form shall not reduce the applicable amount of insurance.”

Under contract law, the insurer’s financial obligation to the insured is over when the limits of insurance have been fully used to pay claims. However, the unique nature of insurance contracts has resulted in insurers including the reinstatement clause in commercial and other property insurance policies. This clause means that the limits of insurance provided by the policy remain unchanged for the entire policy period, regardless of the number and amounts of claims paid.

10.3.7.3.3 Subrogation Clause

“The insurer, upon making any payment or assuming liability therefore under this form, shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery of the insured against others and may bring action to enforce such rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of subrogation are hereby waived against any corporation, firm, individual, or other interest with respect to which insurance is provided by this policy.”

We know that when the insurer pays a claim for damage caused to the insured’s property by others, it is entitled to seek recovery from the responsible party. The insurer agrees not to exercise the right of subrogation against any party having an insurable interest in the property insured, such as payees, business partners, and subsidiary firms.

10.3.7.3.4 Other Common Clauses

There are many other clauses, such as breach of condition, property protection systems, premium adjustments, basis of valuation, property of others, and locked vehicle warranty. These clauses are included in the policy wording and are followed by the definitions and the policy conditions or Statutory Conditions.

10.4 OTHER COVERAGES AVAILABLE

We’ve learned that providing coverage in commercial insurance can be a very complex process, both in terms of the risks presented by the insureds and the policies available. A thorough understanding of the client’s needs, and what is available in the market to meet those needs, requires experience and further study.

We have seen that there are some property and peril exclusions on the policies which would negatively affect a business’s ability to properly operate in the market. There may be other specific circumstances that are not covered by the Named Perils Form or the Broad Form. For example, an insured may have several locations, may have property in transit, or may have property at other off premises locations. We’ll take a brief look at several additional coverages and forms that are available to respond to most client needs. These are only a few examples, and there are many more coverages available to brokers.

10.4.1 Property Away from the Insured Premises Policy

Commercial property insurance coverages apply only at the location noted on the declarations page. For an additional premium, coverage can be purchased and added to the policy to provide for both property in transit (by both the insured’s and others’ vehicles) and property at a temporary location not owned, rented, or controlled by the insured.

10.4.2 Glass Coverage Policy

Limited coverage is available under the Broad Form for exterior glass. Exterior or interior glass (such as in a mall) requires additional coverage. Many tenants, whether in a mall or street-facing building, have leases that require them to be responsible for loss to the glass of their unit. The combination of glass, ornamentation, lettering, and artwork is a significant investment for the insured.

Many insurers’ glass coverage policies provide as few as three exclusions:

1) Fire.

2) War.

3) Nuclear energy hazard.

10.4.3 Valuable Papers and Records Policy

Valuable papers are defined in IFC 51065 as “written, printed and otherwise inscribed documents and records, including books, maps, films, drawings, abstracts, deeds, mortgages and manuscripts but does not mean money or securities.”

Standard commercial property insurance policy coverages restrict payment for records to their blank value only. But when an insured purchases this coverage, all costs of reproducing lost or damaged documents are covered.

10.4.4 Accounts Receivable Policy

Many insureds extend credit to their customers through their business. If those records are destroyed, this policy can offer coverage. The act that destroyed them (that is, the peril) does need to be listed in this policy for it to respond, but the intent of the coverage is to pay the costs of reconstructing accounts receivable records, abnormal expenses incurred in collecting sums due to the insured, and interest charges on loans needed to offset uncollected amounts.

10.4.5 Office Equipment Floater

Businesses operate in a variety of forms, from retail to manufacturing — but offices are extremely common. Unlike retail or manufacturing environments, these office businesses (such as accountants, lawyers, and insurance brokers) do not contain any stock under the strict definition, but they do contain equipment. This policy provides all-risks coverage on all the office equipment, and generally includes accounts receivable, valuable papers, and extra expense.

10.4.6 Electronic Data Processing Policy

Very few businesses can operate without automation. From inventory control in warehouses to sales checkout in retail stores, all businesses rely on automated systems to some degree. Even operations in insurance brokerages, from application to record storage, are digitized. This means a computer failure can result in a total shutdown of a business operation.

Coverage under the standard commercial property forms is often not sufficient to fully address the unique losses that insureds using automated systems are exposed to. The Broad Form typically excludes losses caused by artificially generated electrical currents (for example, a power surge).

The loss of data is excluded under the Broad Form Policy, so insureds need to purchase coverage for the computer system in their office or business through an electronic data processing policy. There is no standard policy for this purpose, so brokers must be aware that the following coverages need to be on the form for their client:

• Loss to data processing systems, including equipment and component parts.

• Active data processing media, including programs.

• Extra expense.

Clients will need coverage for the hardware, the software, and the expenses to rent systems from others until the covered property is back online. An all-risks policy will provide coverage for water losses, including leakage, seepage, freezing, and flood, as well as mechanical breakdown.

There are exclusions on all policies, so be aware of the limitations on each form.

10.4.7 Crime Insurance Policy

Commercial property insurance typically provides coverage for riots, vandalism, and malicious acts. The Broad Form policy provides coverage for theft of stock and equipment. However, even the broadest policies exclude money, securities, jewellery, furs, and other valuable property when the loss is due to a criminal act. As always, brokers need to be deeply knowledgeable about their insured’s business in case there are exposures requiring additional coverages.

Burglary insurance is required in any business where the stock or equipment has high value or by its nature is very attractive to thieves. Burglary insurance will only pay when there are signs of forced entry to or from the insured property. The insured can purchase either mercantile stock burglary insurance or safe burglary insurance.

Robbery insurance is purchased where there is potential loss to money, securities, and other valuable property. Robbery insurance will pay when there is the threat of force against the person having control of the property (for example, a thief threatening a staff member with harm to turn over cash from the register). Robbery insurance applies to both inside and outside the premises.

Theft is the broadest form of crime, involving property taken without the owner’s consent. An insured who purchases theft coverage does not have to purchase burglary or robbery insurance, but the premium will reflect the extent of this coverage. Theft coverage includes options such as: Broad Form (covering stock and equipment); Money and Securities Broad Form; Employee Theft and Fidelity coverages; and the Comprehensive Dishonesty, Disappearance, and Destruction Policy (also known as the 3-D Policy).

The 3-D Policy provides a comprehensive package of crime insurance coverage under a single policy form. It includes five insuring agreements, and there are 48 approved endorsements to this policy which allow the broker to amend the coverage to a particular risk.

10.4.8 Cyber Insurance

Cyber insurance is designed to protect businesses against the financial loss resulting from a range of cyber threats and exposures, including cybercrime, data breach, and system interruption. If a business operates online, sends or receives e-transfers, or processes sensitive data, they require more than a standard policy. Property policies are designed to cover the bricks and mortar of a business, not the digital assets.

Employees at businesses of all types and sizes may not know what to look out for when it comes to phony links or possible malicious files. Clicking or downloading these can lead to a range of issues including extortion (where hackers threaten to expose data that they have accessed) social engineering (where hackers imitate someone to steal money (and ransomware), which can cripple an organization by freezing or damaging business-critical computer systems). These losses are not considered a data breach, but they can lead to severe financial damage and are insurable under a cyber policy.

A cyber insurance policy can give access to technical resources, including IT security experts, forensic investigators, lawyers to give legal advice on ransom demands, and crisis communications specialists who can help manage the situation and get the firm back online as soon as possible. The business interruption section covers the cost of getting data and applications repaired, restored, or recreated if your systems are damaged as a result of a cyber event. It can also reimburse loss of profits as a result of a cyber event interruption.

Policies come with proactive risk management tools, such as employee cybersecurity training programs to help prevent phishing attacks and dark-web monitoring, which scans the dark-web for signs that data relating to the business have been compromised.33

10.4.9 Intellectual Property

Intellectual property (IP) is anything that has been created or commissioned by a business. These can include copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. Examples of IP include photography, product names, designs, software/hardware, logos, inventions, and sound recordings.

An IP insurance policy is coverage designed to protect a business if there is an IP infringement or to provide defense if there is an IP infringement against a business. The policy can cover the legal fees of defending or pursuing a claim, damages, and settlement costs.

In the same realm is copyright insurance, which is designed to protect an organization’s written and creative content, as well as processes and software development, from being replicated or near replicated by another organization. Trademark insurance is to protect brand assets such as logos, recognizable signs, and designs from duplication or use without permission.

The cost of defending or pursuing an IP claim can be extensive and potentially threaten the survival of a company.34

10.4.10 Equipment (Boiler and Machinery) Breakdown Policy

The Broad Form commercial policy is the most common policy sold. Though the policy is all-risk, there are certain perils excluded. As such, where a loss occasioned from those perils would have a disastrous effect on the business operation, a separate policy must be purchased.

There are many working parts of a commercial operation that involve various forms of power generation to drive systems and machinery. The steam, mechanical, and electrical systems of a building all present challenges to be dealt with by the broker in the analysis of the risk.

Loss or damage to any pressure vessels having a normal, internal working pressure above 103 kilopascals or 15 psi are not insured. This includes hot water heaters and compressors used in the building. Steam heat is used to warm pipes to keep fluids moving in a refinery, and compressors drive air-driven mechanical systems. The resultant damage to the building would be excluded.

Loss occasioned by centrifugal force, mechanical, or electrical breakdown in or on the premises is excluded. Centrifuges are used to separate liquids. Mechanical breakdown means a failure in the working mechanism of the machinery, and electrical breakdown means a failure in the electrical mechanism of the machinery, appliance, or device. Electrical breakdown is usually caused by power surges or sudden reductions. It also includes the computers used primarily to stop, start, control, or operate any insured object.

It must be noted that loss by lightning damage, explosion of natural or manufactured gas, or resultant fire is always covered. This is known as a “following fire” and comes from the basic fire policy.

The equipment breakdown coverage form previously known as “boiler and machinery” provides coverage for loss caused by an accident to an “object”. The “object” is any property owned, leased, operated, or controlled by the insured while at the location specified in the policy. This means pressure objects and machinery objects. “Accident” is defined as an event that triggers coverage under the policy. It must be sudden, there must be a breakdown, there must be physical damage to the object, and there must be a need to repair or replace.

This policy provides coverage to the property of the insured and the object in use or connected ready for use at a location. There is a maximum payable for loss from any one accident. The damaged property shall be repaired or replaced with like kind, capacity, size, and quality.

Occurrences of a maintenance nature are not included, such as deterioration, corrosion, wear and tear, and the functioning of a safety device.

One of the unique features of this policy is that inspection services are provided, which will certify the equipment. If the inspector deems the equipment unfit or dangerous, they can tag the equipment and suspend coverage immediately, without notice to mortgagees or others.

10.4.11 Contractor Insurance

Contractors need insurance coverage for the building during construction as well as their tools and the equipment and systems they install in the buildings.

Builder’s risk insurance provides the basis of the policy provided to the contractor, and the tool floater rider, contractor’s equipment rider, and installation floater can be added to it.

A builder’s risk policy can be on either a Named Perils or a Broad form. It provides coverage for the period of construction and are referred to a Course of Construction (COC) policy. It can be purchased on an individual risk basis or on a blanket basis, depending on the number of projects a contractor is involved in. The premium is based on the maximum value of any single project and includes both material and labour. A premium is charged at the inception of the policy. The rate is based on a low inception value as the project gets started, leading to the full construction value at completion. A provisional premium is charged and there may be requirements to report at stated times the values of construction. Within 30 days of completion, the insured is required to advise the actual completed contract price, and the premium is adjusted accordingly. The form is used to provide coverage to insure contractors who are in the business of installation, reconstruction, or repair.

The broad form has three property components. The property during construction, installation, reconstruction, or repair, and any property of others that is integral to the project or that forms part of the completed project. Landscaping that forms part of the project and is included in the valuation and temporary buildings. Scaffolding, forms, and site preparation that form part of the project and are valued in the insurance. Excluded are tools and equipment, whether owned or leased, and the cost of making good faulty material, workmanship, or design.

Coverage normally ceases when the building comes into use or becomes occupied. Coverage automatically ceases when the project has been left unattended or when there has been no construction activity for more than 30 days.

The more restrictive Named Perils form provides coverage that are the same as the Commercial Building, Stock, and Equipment Named Perils Form.

Contractors, mechanics, and carpenters will have major off-premises exposure for loss of tools and equipment. Most commercial property forms restrict coverage for these items to losses occurring on premises. The tool floater rider extends coverage to off-premises coverage. Two of the main exclusions on the all-risk rider are for damage by artificial electricity and mysterious disappearance. Coverage can be provided either on a scheduled basis or on a blanket basis.

Claims are paid on an ACV basis.

The contractor’s equipment floater covers all kinds of moveable equipment owned, rented, or leased by contractors, including cranes, loaders, and road-building machinery, air compressors, cement mixers, and welding machines. The coverage can be written on either a scheduled or blanket basis. There is a provision for newly acquired equipment with a 30-day reporting limit.

As with any all-risk policy, there are exclusions. This form excludes losses caused by exceeding the load limit on a piece of equipment, mechanical or electrical breakdown, extremes of temperature, and rust or corrosion.

The Installation Floater is designed for contractors who specialize in the installation of machinery and equipment. Examples would be plumbing, heating, and air conditioning firms. The property covered may consist of “the property of the insured and of others for which the insured is legally liable or to be used in the or incidental to the installation operations of the insured”. It provides coverage while in transit (by most forms of transportation, including common carrier or insured’s vehicle), while awaiting installation at the site, and during installation, up to the time the interest of the insured ceases.

Premium is based on the contractor’s annual receipts. A provisional premium is charged at inception and balanced out at conclusion based on the receipts.

There are exclusions to this all-risks form, such as property while located at premises owned, leased, or occupied by the insured (coverage afforded under the Commercial Property policy), tools or equipment owned by the insured or others (covered under the tool floater), and losses caused directly or indirectly by faulty workmanship or material unless fire or explosion ensues. The values insured should properly reflect the maximum values likely to be exposed to loss in any one occurrence.35

10.5 SPECIFIC POLICY FORMS

In this section, we’ll look at some of the essential policies that businesses must either (1) have or (2) be made clearly aware that they need. We’ll examine each and how they are applied.

10.5.1 Business Interruption Insurance

Businesses run on their own will, planning, and funding — but they may experience a stop to their operations that they did not entirely intend. When external factors pressure a business to cease operations, this can be considered a business interruption. However, business interruptions are not always straightforward, so let’s look into this policy.

Commercial property insurance policies typically insure only the direct damage caused to the building, stock, and equipment. When there is a significant loss to property, one of two things can happen:

1) The business may be forced to close for a lengthy period. A closure lasting a few days may reduce the company’s business, while a lengthy closure (for example, weeks or months) can be disastrous (for example, the months-long closures during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic).

2) The business is able to resume partial operations only at the insured or other locations.

Business interruptions can come from many different sources other than damage to property. There can be a failure or breakdown of public utilities, transportation accidents (for example, the 1979 Mississauga train derailment), damage to neighbouring premises, loss caused by property damage of a major supplier, or actions of a regulatory authority.

During this period, when income is stopped, insureds have a few options to get their business back up and operating. They can dip into their own capital reserves (if they have any) or they can take out a bank loan (which they have to pay back from future earnings). Unfortunately, most businesses that experience a major property loss fail to reopen after three months, because they are unable to pay for continuing expenses during the interruption. Transferring that risk to an insurance company can help ensure the survival of that business.

Business interruption serves the following functions:

• It is a contract of indemnity, designed to restore the lost income to a level it would have been prior to the loss. It pays the business’s ongoing expenses (including salaries for key management personnel, taxes, and mortgage payments) and expenses which continue after a loss, as well as lost profits.

• It insures the same perils as the property policy.

• Its coverage is not limited to the policy period. Business interruption coverage starts on the day of the loss to the property and can continue for a specified period (usually 12 months). It will continue even if the property policy expires during that period.

• It will pay expenses when they are required to reduce the amount of the loss.

Note: Business interruption insurance is not a standalone policy form. Coverages are provided through endorsement to the property policy. Additionally, business interruption indemnity must first be triggered by a coverage occurrence under the property section.

There are two key approaches to business interruption coverage, as well as a third option:

1) Gross Earnings Form: The indemnity period commences at the time of loss and ceases upon reinstatement of the lost or damaged property. By ceasing payment at this time, the Gross Earnings Form assumes that the insured is returning to the competitive position they were immediately prior to the loss.

2) Profits Form: The indemnity period commences at the time of loss and continues until the income is restored to the level that would have been earned if the loss had not occurred, subject to the indemnity period selected at inception. The assumption here is that, although the doors of the business are open, the business has not been restored to its former competitive position. It will take time before profits are restored to the pre-loss level and to win back customers after a prolonged interruption. The Profits Form has a higher premium due to this longer coverage period.

Note: Both forms normally insure loss of income for a 12-month period. This can be increased for an additional premium.

3) Extra expense insurance endorsement: This is not a true business interruption insurance form because it does not insure loss of income. Instead, this form insures the necessary extra expenses or costs incurred by insureds in continuing normal business operations after a loss. Businesses purchasing this coverage include those which could (or need) to be back in business after a short interruption, such as insurance brokers, travel agents, doctors, an banks. In these situations, the business’s physical location is important, but not vital in the short term — so lost income due to location loss is not of major concern for these types of businesses.

Extra expense coverage is limited to those expenses that are over and above those which normally would have been incurred by the insured had the loss not occurred. These extra costs include:

• Renting temporary premises.

• Renting temporary equipment.

• Paying overtime salaries.

The insured would buy a single limit, and payment is spread out over a defined period.

Note: This form should be added for any insured who has either the Gross Earnings Form or the Profits Form.

Brokers are often intimidated by business interruption insurance, because they think that they need an accounting background to make the calculations required to get the right amounts for the correct policy limit. While it is true that a basic understanding of income and expenses is very valuable, many brokers use a work sheet to help in the calculations. Once you’ve gained more experience and pursued further study, you’ll feel better prepared to deal with this very important coverage.

10.6 SURETY BONDS

The concept of surety is thousands of years old. It means the state of being sure, certain, and secure — but by extension, it has also come to mean a guarantee of performance made by one person or entity for another. Its basic function is to eliminate risk to the person to whom the promise of performance is made.

However, surety is not the same as insurance! Surety, by its very nature, requires special noninsurance skills, such as accounting and finance. Though experience is a great teacher, some ancillary skills are required before a broker should enter the field of surety bonding.

The seven characteristics of a surety bond are:

1) There are three parties to a contract.

Image

The principal is the party primarily liable (for example, a contractor hired to build a house).

Image

The obligee is the party to whom someone else is obligated under contract (for example, the owner of the house needing the contractor).

Image

The surety is the party who promises to pay (money) or to perform some other act if the principal fails to fulfill their contractual obligation (for example, a bonding company affiliated with the house contractor).

2) No losses are expected.

Image

The surety thoroughly investigates the creditworthiness and business experience of the principal and extends credit without risk.

3) The principal is liable to the surety.

Image

If the principal fails in its obligation to the obligee (for example, fails to build the house), the surety must fulfill that promise. The principal is then obligated to the surety for the amounts it paid.

4) There is a bond premium, which is effectively a service fee. This is a fee charged for prequalification and company expenses to underwrite the risk.

5) There is a bond limit, or penalty, which the surety will pay to the obligee if the principal defaults. The penalty remains unchanged through the contract period.

6) A surety is of indeterminate length and non-cancellable.

Image

7) It is a written contract and executed under seal of the surety and principal.

Image

Termination occurs when the principal’s obligation has been fulfilled.

Image

Oral contracts are not binding on the surety.

Note: The guarantee provided by the surety can be viewed as an extension of credit, as it is the amount of funds available to the obligee if the principal defaults. For sureties to qualify principals, they look at three criteria called the “Three Cs.”

Character: A review of the company’s management performance to assess if they are of good character, have a good reputation in their industry and pay their bills promptly.

Capacity: Does the principal have the knowledge, experience, and labour pool necessary to do the job?

Capital: Does the principal have the financial capability to complete current jobs in addition to taking on future jobs?

Once the principal has met all Three Cs, the surety then decides whether to qualify them for a bond and at what rates.

10.6.1 Types of Surety Bonds

Surety bonds include many types of contract bonds. For example, there are:

• Construction bonds: The owners of a project face various risks in the management of the project. Successful bidders who fail to enter into the project can stall the project and cost time and money. Contractors who fail to complete the project on time and on budget can jeopardize the project. Contractors who fail to pay their sub-trades and suppliers can result in protracted litigation. In response to these challenges, contractors provide bid bonds, performance bonds, labour and material payment bonds, and maintenance bonds to cover warranty of the completed work.

The size of the bonds a contractor can get is based on their capacity, which is also defined (see above) as the maximum amount of surety credit a surety company will provide. Surety credit is the size of the bond that will be made available to the contractor and is based on the largest single project the surety would be willing to consider for a bond.

Contractors may source a bond for a particular individual project, but most often they develop a relationship with a surety to prearrange limits. They pre-qualify themselves for bonds and pre-set their capacity so they can enter the bidding process in a timely manner. As the contractor gains in experience and grows in capital, their capacity expands. As the contractor establishes greater capacity, they can bid on larger and more complex projects.

A portion of capacity determination is based on a multiplier of the contractor’s working capital. If they had $1M in working capital, they could qualify for $10-$20M in credit. This would, for example, give a contractor the opportunity to bid on a $5M individual project with a maximum of $20M aggregate on all other bonded work.

• Fiduciary bonds: These are required for each insurance brokerage under the RIB Act. Fiduciary bonds are required when you have people in a position of trust who are handling the funds of others. These bonds also apply to persons appointed by the courts to act as estate administrators, guardians, or trustees.

Estate administrators are one of the most common fiduciary bonds. This bond guarantees the faithful performance of the administration, according to law, of a deceased person’s estate. The court-appointed administrator, or the executor named in the will, have a responsibility to settle estates either as specified in the will or as approved by the court.

A guardian is a person nominated in a will and appointed by the court to manage the affairs of a minor. The guardianship bond guarantees that the guardian will perform their duties faithfully, observe the directives of the court, and account for all money and other property when required by the court. Failure to do so makes the guardian liable to the court.

Upon application for bankruptcy, a trustee is appointed by the court to liquidate all assets and divide the remaining assets among the creditors. A Trustee Bond is filed with the court guaranteeing the faithful performance of the duties according to the rules. Failure to do so makes the trustee liable to the court.

• Customs and excise bonds: These are required for custom-bonded warehouses which guarantee the collection of duty and taxes on goods brought into the country.

• License and permit bonds: These are required by all levels of government for businesses operating under their respective jurisdictions. Businesses operating publicly must post the required bonds to ensure they meet the statutes, regulations, or ordinances under which they operate. This is meant to protect the general welfare of the public.

In summary, bonds can produce many different forms, and there are situations where there is no existing bond form. In these cases, the surety company may agree to issue a bond based on a proposed wording submitted by the applicant. In all cases, the purpose is to make the obligee feel sure, certain, and secure in their relationship with the principal.

10.7 PACKAGE POLICIES

For individually rated commercial policies, insurers use both the Named Perils Form and Broad Form (but the Broad Form is by far the more common policy in use today). However, their use as standalone forms is decreasing as package policies become more popular. The insurance industry thrives on competition, and insurers are always looking for ways to attract new business.

The package policy accomplishes just that. It is a multi-peril, multi-line policy which incorporates all coverages under a single policy form. These policies are developed with specific industries or associations in mind, so they incorporate extensions, coverages, and limits that are unique to that industry or association.

Package policy coverages are not standardized, but they generally include the following:

• Property insurance.

• Business interruption insurance.

• Liability insurance.

• Crime insurance.

Premiums are based on what the insurer deems to be the quality of the average exposure, and credits are given for select or superior risks. Though there is a common form for each program, the credits earned by the individual risk quality make each package policy unique to the insured.

The advantage of package policies is the simplicity of the application form. Premiums are easily determined, coverage is usually more than adequate for most risks, and the broad coverages provided eliminate many of the claims problems common to the more limited forms.

The disadvantage of this approach is that one size does not fit all. When brokers conduct their surveys, they must identify areas where the package policy’s preset limits may have a serious effect on the coverage limits required by the insured. Because package policies lack standardization, it is difficult to make comparisons. Over-reliance on the package policy may leave some insureds seriously underinsured. Ultimately, an individually tailored commercial policy may be a more effective way to deal with your clients’ insurance needs.

10.8 COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE & THE SHARING ECONOMY

What you are about to study in this section is only the tip of the iceberg. It is important to remember that commercial insurance is both a very complicated client base and policy space to be in. Again, we reiterate, you should have a few years’ experience as a proficient personal lines broker at least before going into the commercial lines of insurance. Now, let’s take a look into two areas of commercial insurance, commercial automobile and the sharing economy.

10.8.1 Licensing of Commercial Operators

OAP 1, Section 1 1.4.5 states: “You agree not to drive or operate the automobile, or allow anyone else to drive or operate the automobile, while not authorized by law.” Because of this condition, certain accident benefits are also forfeited under the same rule (see Section 4.4 Limitations on Your Coverage). The Ontario “G” license for motor vehicles, includes snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), but motorcycles require an “M” license. So, for any person to operate these personal lines vehicles, there is an existing government licensing structure.

For commercial uses of vehicles, a “G” license is sufficient for vehicles with a total weight under 11,000 kgs, whereas for vehicles over 11,000 kgs, a “D” license is required. The law also states that no person shall drive or operate a commercial motor vehicle over 4,500 kgs gross weight on a highway unless the operator is a holder of a commercial vehicle operators registration (CVOR). A CVOR is issued by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), and it must be carried at all times for inspection reasons. There is an annual inspection process of these vehicles required and managed by the MTO.

10.8.2 Commercial Automobile Insurance

We have seen that the OAP 1 provides the mandatory and optional coverages required to operate a properly licensed motor vehicle in Ontario and that coverage extends to Canada and the United States. Within that policy, there are exclusions and limitations that require the application of specific endorsements to extend coverage to these uses. Carrying passengers for compensation, the contents of vehicles and trailers (whether owned or for hire), or the non-personal use of the vehicle affect the rating of the vehicles and coverages.

Image

We still use the OAP 1 policy, but we amend the rating to consider the change or increase in the risk or exposure. When the automobile or light truck is used for more than commuting to and from work, or is now used to call on clients, it is given a business rating. A small contractor or a plumber with a light vehicle (such as a pickup truck or panel van) would be given a commercial rating, but this can still be covered on a personal lines policy. A commercial vehicle supplement (CVS) is used by the broker to help determine whether a risk should stay in personal lines or move to commercial lines.

When a vehicle is used to carry passengers for compensation (such as a taxi, school bus or driver training school vehicle), a series of OPCF 6 endorsements are added to the vehicle, and the appropriate increased rating and premium are applied to the vehicle. Provincial or state liability requirements for public vehicles may also affect coverages.

When a vehicle is rated in the “heavy” class, coverage typically moves to commercial automobile insurance.

Because commercial automobile insurance requires an understanding of different kinds of vehicles and how they are being used, it requires a more technical approach to underwriting. When a business operation owns a few vehicles, each can be insured on either one or several automobile policies, and a premium and rating are applied to each vehicle. When an operation gets larger and owns multiple vehicles, which may or may not include trailers, the policy format changes to determine how to rate and charge a premium for the exposure, but it does not change the policy from the OAP 1.

When shifting an automobile policy from personal lines to commercial lines, underwriters will also begin to consider with items such as cargo and attached equipment where the underwriters in the commercial lines property and liability department would be called on to provide coverage.

Commercial lines automobile insurance includes both individual rated commercial automobiles (IRCA) (which can be scheduled if there is more than one vehicle) and fleet rated policies. IRCA are scheduled on a per unit basis to reflect the individual limits and coverages per vehicle. There may be different coverages on different vehicles within the list.

A fleet rated risk involves four or more vehicles under a common ownership, and the rating can be either on a scheduled or fleet basis. A scheduled basis is where each unit is noted, coverages are shown, and a premium is charged. Vehicles to be added, deleted, or substituted are reported as they occur to the insurer. Fleets can also be covered on a blanket basis by adding an OPCF 21 endorsement (which has several forms), where the fleet owner reports vehicles either owned or leased monthly. Large fleets with varying needs would use this method to control expenses. The premium charged can be based on either monthly receipts or mileage. This method more accurately reflects the risk exposure. The busier a business is, or the more extensive its range of operations (for example, long-haul trucking to the United States as opposed to local haulage), will determine the premium paid. Seasonal variations are also brought into play in determining premium. Vehicles laid up in the winter would reduce the premium, whereas increased use in the summer would increase the premium.

Image

Coverage for contents (that is, the cargo) of a commercial vehicle is excluded under an OAP 1 and requires the services of an inland marine underwriter. Inland marine provides coverage against loss or damage to cargo while in transit. The carrier is called a “bailee for hire” and is responsible for certain losses caused to property while in their possession. These carriers fit into three categories, depending on how they operate their business:

• common carriers (like tractor trailers that you pass on the highway),

• contract carriers (like the vans that deliver Amazon packages), and

• private carriers (like company-branded vehicles for Leon’s furniture or Voila).

Common carriers are subject to provincial, interstate, and municipal regulations requiring the issuance of insurance certificates. This is to show they carry proper liability coverages from an acceptable insurer. They are also subject to regulated tariffs that set both the rates carriers can charge and the liability for the types of goods carried. Common carriers would protect themselves by purchasing a truckman’s liability cargo rider, which provides coverage for goods they carry. As the carrier picks up and drops off from various locations through the day or week, they may face challenges in determining the value of the cargo they are hauling. The cargo limit on the rider may be inadequate for the value of the goods they are hauling. The owners of the property being transported would probably have their own transportation floater added to their property policy or have a trip transit policy for single shipments.

Contract carriers only carry goods for certain customers where responsibility for goods carried is determined by the individual contracts, and private carriers carry only their own goods. Each of would know the value of goods carried and have the proper insurance in place. For example, a local furniture or grocery store hires vehicles for doing home delivery. The owner of the property would normally provide the coverage for the goods being transported. They would add a motor cargo rider or transportation rider to their property policy.

When a commercial operation has attached equipment on its vehicles, the use of that attached equipment is excluded from the auto policy by endorsement (OPCF 30). Both liability and accident benefits are now excluded when the equipment is used. Coverage is put back on to that equipment by a commercial liability policy. Cranes and hoisting equipment, welders, and drilling rigs are examples where multiple policies are required to provide the proper coverage for commercial exposure.

Brokers dealing with commercial automobile exposures need to have an increased awareness of the exposures presented by the insured. They need to have thorough training in all the forms that customize a policy, because failure to properly underwrite the risk can result in large E&O claims.

10.8.3 Sharing Economy

The sharing economy first appeared over 20 years ago in the United States. It emphasized the collaborative use or consumption of goods and/or services within the general public. Also known as the “gig economy”, this is predominately based on software platforms to connect providers to customers, facilitating transactions between these two parties without the need to invest in new property, locations, equipment, or much extra capital. Today, most of us know Uber and Airbnb, but Etsy, Fiverr, and SkipTheDishes are extensions of this economic model into more specific industries. Your clients could very well be using one of these services, and you might not even know to ask. However, it is incumbent upon the broker to conduct a thorough needs assessment with every client, commercial or not, to identify all risks a client is exposed to so any policy issued will be an accurate reflection of their true exposures.

10.8.3.1 Ride Sharing

Image

Ride sharing is defined as an arrangement in which a passenger travels in a private vehicle, usually for a fee, and arranged by means of a website or a mobile application (or “app”)36. Because the use of the driver’s personal automobile is the premise of ride sharing (which changes the definition of “taxi”), and the OAP 1 excludes the use of paying customers, this new category risked leaving the driver without having coverage if an accident occurs while a paying customer is in their vehicle or while they are working for the ride sharing company. Since 2018, insurers have stepped in to provide specific coverage for ride sharing to provide coverage back to the vehicle owner if they are involved in an accident, including liability risks.

The pervasiveness of ride sharing workers means that many auto policyholders could very well be supplementing their income by driving for a fee, which means brokers must ask specific questions about uses of any personal automobile.

10.8.3.2 Accommodation Sharing

Many people today choose to stay not in a hotel, but in someone’s condo, house, or cottage when travelling. Accommodation sharing, also known as “short-term rental”, is a huge economy consisting of multiple international and local apps and a sizeable percentage of the housing inventory of any given country. On Airbnb alone, more than seven million dwellings were available with over 115 million bookings in 202237, making it highly likely that some clients are listing their dwellings as short-term rentals.

Accommodation sharing is defined as renting part or all of a property for a short period, including a primary or secondary residence. It also includes any rentals facilitated by a third party, a website, or an app38. Similar to ride sharing, it is vital that a broker do a thorough needs assessment of every client to capture their operation of their property, as much as identifying the structure itself, to ensure that the policy issued reflects the reality of the business, no matter how much of the property is engaged or how often.

10.9 CONCLUSION

This chapter has given you a peek into the world of commercial insurance, which can be more varied, complex, and costly than personal insurance. Commercial insurance is a field that takes time to develop expertise and competence in — but it’s one that many brokers strive to learn as their careers develop. Take some time to review the glossary and complete the quiz. See you in Chapter 11!
