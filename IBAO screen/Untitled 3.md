10.1 INTRODUCTION

Commercial buildings in Canada come in every shape and size imaginable. Physically, the buildings can range from small-frame, historic brick buildings all the way to modern, multi-storey, multifunctional fire-resistive buildings — and everything in between. Commercial insurance is a vast topic, and it takes brokers years to gain the experience they need to competently advise clients about it — but this chapter will give you an overview of the considerations involved.

10.2 THE COMPLEXITY OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET

For our purposes, we’ll consider any building that is not a residential structure as a commercial risk. This means that we’ll be viewing condominiums and apartments as commercial structures as well (because although they are residential in occupancy, they have an operating/management company).

Image

The occupancy of these buildings is as varied as the buildings themselves. Business operations can differ vastly based on whether they produce a product or offer a service. They can be anything from simple (such as a single-person carpenter shop) to complex (such as a hospital or a large automotive manufacturing plant). Different types of business operations, and their different types of exposure, are also known as mercantile risks. The Canadian business landscape ranges from forestry, mining, fishing, and other primary industries to sophisticated bio-engineering companies doing cutting-edge genetic research. Additionally, each business has different types of protection available to it, such as public or private protection fire halls or central station alarm connections.

It’s natural to assume that densely populated urban locations come with greater risks, but smaller rural locations present just as many risk challenges as their larger urban counterparts. No matter where a building is, brokers need to conduct a thorough review of its location, occupancy, and operations to adequately determine its level of risk and, subsequently, its insurance requirements.

10.2.1 Small Risks vs. Large Risks

Just like property and automobile insurance, a lot has been done over the years to standardize and formalize the process of assessing the risks for businesses. Many insurance companies have created package policies that already include most of the coverages certain businesses need based on their industry.

Smaller risks (such as salons, convenience stores, or landscapers) often involve a limited number of exposures, so a package policy is often sufficient for these businesses. This is often the most cost effective method of providing insurance to businesses that have many common elements.

However, package policies are not a one-size-fits-all product. Some may allow additional limits or coverages to be incorporated, but overall, the scope of a package policy is not very broad. When working with commercial clients, make the effort to properly and realistically assess the business’s needs to find where gaps lie in the package policy. Then, ensure the policy is thoroughly reviewed and analyzed for every risk.

Larger, more complex risks require the broker to have a sound understanding of how each business operates, the nature of the products or services it offers, and the geographical reach of the business. These risks do not fit into the mold of a package policy, so they must be individually underwritten. Commercial insurance brokers selling individual policies need to have a far broader knowledge of both the client’s business operations and the insurance policy wordings. They’ll also gain a deeper understanding of different insurance companies’ underwriting appetites for certain classes of risk. Complex risks require complex solutions, and brokers need deep experience, training, and skill to properly provide the best coverage for these commercial clients. (See more about subscription policies in Chapter 2, Section 2.7.1)

For our purposes, a simple understanding of the two basic policy forms — the Named Perils Form and the Broad Form — will be sufficient to lay a foundation that you can build on later in your career. This chapter will introduce you to the complexity of this subject, but you’ll need further study and practical experience to become a competent commercial lines broker.

10.3 BASIC POLICY FORMS

The first step in the insurance process is to do a thorough survey of the insurance prospect. Most brokers conduct an interview-like process to ask key questions and record the client’s responses. All brokerages will have a commercial survey form (or similarly named questionnaire) containing the necessary questions to properly identify the risks presented by the client. Many of these questions will require some effort and evidence from both the broker and the client to determine the proper answers. For example, current valuations on building, stock, and equipment can take time to determine and may come from different sources.

Remember: it’s up to the insured — not the broker — to make the final determination of values. If a broker assumes or guesses at the policy limits on the client’s behalf, and the limits fall short in an actual claim, the broker will risk an errors and omissions (E&O) claim.

This process may seem very complicated compared to personal lines insurance. Personal property insurance has largely been reduced to algorithmic underwriting to create a computergenerated policy. In a Homeowner Policy, limits are set from the Home Evaluation Calculator, and all the limits and coverages follow from the one figure. Whether the insured has outbuildings or jewellery is irrelevant to the limits on the policy; a broker can add coverages, but they cannot delete the standard policy coverages. In personal lines insurance, only exceptions to the norm will require physical underwriting.

In contrast, a broker who is looking at a commercial insurance exposure needs to consider all the physical components of the risk. There are three main physical components to a risk:

1) Building.

2) Stock.

3) Equipment.

Let’s look at how these components are defined in the Commercial Property Broad Form (IBC 4037).

10.3.1 Building

Image

“‘Building’ means the building(s) described on the Declarations Page, including temporary locations and newly acquired locations, if they are to be covered by this form. These are defined as:

1. Fixed structures pertaining to the building and located on the premises.”

“Premises” are defined as the entire area within the property lines and areas under adjoining sidewalks and driveways. It includes erected pole signs, yard lights, and perimeter fencing constructed on the premises. Each structure must be noted on the declarations to be covered by the policy.

“2. Additions and extensions communicating and in contact with the building.

3. Permanent fittings and fixtures attached to and forming part of the building(s).”

The value of plumbing, heating, air conditioning, lighting fixtures, wall-to-wall carpeting, and other permanently installed equipment is included in this amount.

“4. Materials, equipment and supplies on the premises for the maintenance of, and the normal repairs and minor alterations of the building or for building services.”

Any material on site for new construction or major renovation would not be covered.

“5. Growing trees, plants, shrubs or flowers inside the building use for decorative purposes when the insured is the owner of the building.”

This applies to the owner of the building, because a tenant would not have an insurable interest in the building.

10.3.2 Stock

Image

“Stock” is defined as:

“1. Merchandise of every description usual to the insured’s business.”

The type of business in which the insured is engaged will usually be indicated on the declarations page. When a client purchases stock insurance, they receive coverage for all merchandise or items sold that are usual to that business. For example, If the insured’s business was described as a bookstore, but they submit a claim for bicycles sold by the shop, the insurer would have grounds to deny such a claim.

The rate and premium charged are based largely on the nature of the stock, because there is a wide variation in susceptibility to loss from one type of stock to another. For example, high-end bicycles have a higher potential for loss and would warrant a higher premium.

“2. Packing, wrapping and advertising materials.”

This includes all material used to distribute any of the merchandise sold. It includes advertising and promotional material, such as flyers and catalogues.

“3. Similar property belonging to others which the insured is under obligation to keep insured or for which the insured is obligated.”

Note that, under this definition, the property lost or damaged must be similar to that insured by the policy. This means that goods held on consignment must be similar to those stated on the declarations page.

The insured must have had an obligation to keep the property insured. The normal practice is to have a written agreement in place outlining the obligations of both parties.

Additionally, the insured must have been legally obligated either as a bailee or based on the standard of ordinary care. From an underwriting point of view, it is important to know the nature of all the stock in a building and how it relates to the insured’s business.

10.3.3 Equipment

Image

“Equipment” is defined as:

“1. Generally all contents usual to the Insured’s business, including furniture, furnishings, fittings, fixtures, machinery, tools, utensils and appliances other than ‘building and stock’.”

Equipment can include office furniture, fittings, and display cases, as well as machinery ranging from air compressors to forklifts.

“2. Similar property belonging to others which the insured is under obligation to keep insured or for which they are legally liable.”

You might remember this clause from the definition of “stock,” and the intention is identical. Many operations lease or rent equipment, such as photocopiers, computers, office furniture, and forklifts, so this definition includes those items. Brokers need to know not only what is owned, but also any lease agreements related to the business.

“3. Tenants improvements, which are defined as building improvements, alterations and betterments made at the expense of the Insured to a ‘building’ occupied by the insured and which are not otherwise insured provided the Insured is not the owner of the building.”

Renting space in multi-use buildings — such as malls or high-rise buildings — is very cost effective for many insureds. The space is often unfinished and the tenant/insured finishes the space to their own specifications. These tenant improvements and betterments are normally left in the building when they leave. Because the tenant has no interest in the building, but they paid for these improvements and betterments, these tenant improvements must be insured as equipment on the tenant’s policy.

If the insured purchases the use interest on tenant improvements made by the previous tenant, this form applies as though the tenant improvements had been made at the expense of the insured.

Once the broker has identified these components and given the appropriate values by the insured, the broker can then analyze the risk exposure each component presents. However, there may be challenges to ensuring adequate limits are met. To ensure adequacy of limit we apply the co-insurance clause with a co-insurance factor dependent on the type of building, operation and products (discussed in Section 10.3.5). Once all these parts are determined, we can then look at the type of policy required to meet the insured’s requirements and expectations.

10.3.4 Determining Insurance Values

Remember: the onus is upon the insured — not the broker — to establish the amount of insurance required and to prove the amount of any loss (per Statutory Condition 6: Requirements After Loss). The broker’s role is to provide the advice, guidance, and direction the insured needs to meet those obligations. A major part of the broker’s role is ensuring that the insureds know the level of property values required for insurance purposes and guiding them towards insuring to those levels. Brokers are not property appraisers, but they can assist the insured in completing standard industry forms. Established appraisal firms or local building contractors with relevant experience can also help in determining building valuations.

There are various ways of determining value, but for our purposes, we’ll limit ourselves to two options: actual cash value (ACV) and replacement cost (RC). The traditional meaning of ACV is the cost to repair or replace lost or damaged property, less the application of any depreciation. In other words, it’s today’s price, less depreciation. RC represents the costs to repair, replace, or rebuild the lost or damaged property, without deduction for depreciation. Insuring a building on an RC basis usually requires a proper appraisal.

Stock is insured on ACV basis, whereas equipment can be insured on either. Again, the onus is on the insured to provide the proper data to ensure adequate limits in case of loss. These limits can be determined from invoices and inventory figures, and they are probably easier to determine than building values. (This is particularly true for older buildings, whose valuations can be more subjective.)

When the stock limit is consistent throughout the year, one limit is shown on the policy. There are some businesses where the limit fluctuates throughout the year and there are clearly defined peak months with a significant increase in value. Those retailers catering to the seasonal holiday market (for example, New Year, Christmas, and Diwali) would have a large increase in the months prior to the that holiday period. Inventories plunge after that period and are restocked again over the year. The peak season endorsement allows pre-determined increases in stock limits so the insured is not paying for unnecessary coverage during the down times.

Package policies catering to these types of businesses include an automatic increase (for example, 25% during the stated period) without making an actual endorsement to the policy. Those who do not have a package policy, such as a manufacturing operation, would be required to make an annual valuation of stock to make sure there is adequate coverage.32

10.3.5 Co-insurance Clause

Below is an example of a co-insurance clause:

“This clause applies separately to each item for which a co-insurance percentage is specified on the Declarations page and only where the total loss exceeds the lesser of 2% of the applicable amount of insurance or $5000.

The insured shall maintain insurance concurrent with this form on the property insured to the extent of at least the co-insurance percentage specified on the Declarations page of the Actual Cash Value (ACV) thereof and failing to do so, shall only be entitled to recover that portion of loss that the amount of insurance in force at the time of loss bears to the amount of insurance required to be maintained by this clause.”

In commercial property, the insurer will normally require the insured to purchase an amount of insurance which, as a minimum, is equivalent to a predetermined percentage of the property’s value (usually 80% or 90%). When the amount of insurance purchased is less than this amount, the insured will be required to share in any future loss (that is, pay themselves). The formula used to determine the amount of the loss to be borne by the insured is included in the policy’s co-insurance clause.

The co-insurance clause exists because many people will deliberately under-insure to reduce the amount of premium they pay. Others may be careless in their estimate of current values and end up woefully under-insured. In other cases, they are expecting to suffer only a partial loss, so they base their purchasing decisions on that expectation. However, in the event of a total loss, insureds often expect full payment for partial losses — even if they failed to pay sufficient premium to cover the whole property.

The co-insurance clause prevents this from happening. In the event of a total loss, the payout to the insured is limited by the policy limit purchased. This means that, if the insured is underinsured, they would suffer a financial loss to the amount they are under-insured for. In the event of a partial loss, they would also be penalized by only receiving payment based on the formula which determines that shortfall.

Confused? Let’s look at an example.

John insures his $1,000,000 commercial property for $10,000. If his property is totally destroyed, should he expect his insurance to pay for $1,000,000 or $10,000?

It makes little sense to pay 100% of all losses when the amount of insurance purchased is significantly less than the total value of the property.

Sandy owns the unit next to John. Her commercial property is valued at and insured for $1,000,000. If she suffers the same loss as John, should she expect her policy to help pay for John’s loss?

It is unfair to ask other insureds who purchase the required amount of insurance to subsidize those who do not.

10.3.5.1 The Formula

Co-insurance uses a straightforward formula to determine the proper amount of coverage for a business (including building, stock, and equipment).

Did ÷ Should × Amount of the Loss = Settlement

In the equation above, Did is the amount of insurance purchased, and Should is the percentage of insurance required (80% or 90%) × actual cash value (ACV).

Consider this example:

Antonia owns a building with an ACV of $300,000, but she purchased an insurance policy with a limit of only $150,000. The policy included an 80% co-insurance clause. Antonia then suffered a $30,000 loss.

Let’s calculate Antonia’s amount payable:

Image
Did 	÷ 	Should 	= 		× 	Loss
$150,000 		$240,000 		0.625 		$30,000
	Amount Paid 	$18,750

Under her co-insurance clause, Antonia would receive only $18,750. This means she would become a “co-insurer” in the loss and would pay a penalty of $11,250 because she failed to purchase adequate limits on her policy.

The co-insurance would be waived if the claim was less than 2% of the applicable amount of insurance, or $5,000. This facilitates the adjustment of small claims.

In the event of a loss, the insurer will make payment based on the lowest of:

• The amount calculated using the co-insurance formula.

• The limit of insurance.

• The amount of the loss.

10.3.5.2 Deductible Clause

When a loss is subject to a co-insurance penalty, the amount of the loss is calculated first, followed by the amount of the deductible. In the example above, the insurer would first calculate the loss of $18,750 and then apply the appropriate deductible. If that deductible was $1,000, the net payment to Antonia would be $17,750.

10.3.6 Risk Analysis

The risk factor that each insured presents is based on both their location’s physical and operational factors. Where a building is located, the protection afforded to it, and the type and value of its contents (stock and equipment) all have a bearing on the determination of rate and subsequently the premium.

The acronym COPE (which stands for Construction, Occupancy, Protection, and Exposure) can be used to describe the physical state of a risk:

1) Construction.

• Masonry and fire-resistive buildings that use modern building materials make a risk more attractive than a frame structure.

• The age of the building impacts the viability of its mechanical components and has a direct relation on whether a building meets modern building and fire codes.

2) Occupancy.

• The occupancy of the building by both the insured and others will affect the fire rate.

• In multi-occupancy buildings, the occupant with the highest exposure will affect the rate of all the building occupants.

• The type of contents (either raw or finished products) and the manufacturing process to produce those items directly affects the rate. For example, an insurance broker’s office would generate a rate well below a plastic parts manufacturer with highly flammable stock.

3) Protection.

• The availability and type of fire protection has a direct effect on the rate. Public protection includes the distance from fire hydrants (which determines water supply) and the number of local professional full-time fire stations (which determines response time). Private protection includes the internal activities of the building to prevent or reduce loss (such as sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and properly installed and monitored central station fire detection systems). These protections will reduce the rate for a risk.

4) Exposure.

Location

• Primarily, the exposure is tied to the physical location, such as what is located to the left, right, front and back of a risk. The physical location has a direct effect on the rate. The distance from other buildings, the construction of neighbouring buildings, and the character of the neighbourhood all impact the rate.

Claims History

• Additionally, the insurer will review the claims history of the insured and of similar businesses over a period of time (for example, the previous five years) to determine both the frequency and average severity of losses. Even though a loss is an unforeseen event in the future, the past history of both the insured and the industry is a pretty good indication of the likelihood of loss.

10.3.7 Policy Forms

Next, we will discuss two policy forms — the Named Perils Form and the Broad Form — that are used to provide coverage after the risk has been properly surveyed and the limits and risk exposure have been determined.

10.3.7.1 Named Perils Form (IBC 4036)

The Named Perils Form (IBC 4036) is a very basic form that provides limited coverage for a risk. It can be used for difficult risks or for risks that require only limited coverages.

The Named Perils Form provides coverage for:

• Fire.

• Lightning, including loss or damage to electrical devices.

• Explosion (limited).

• Impact by aircraft, spacecraft, or land vehicles.

• Riot, vandalism, or malicious acts.

• Smoke due to a sudden, unusual, and faulty operation of any stationary furnace.

• Leakage from fire protective equipment.

• Windstorm or hail.

This commercial Named Perils Form is comparable to a specified perils policy in habitational insurance. For a claim to be paid, the loss has to be caused by one of the insured perils.

10.3.7.2 Broad Form (IBC 4037)

The Broad Form (IBC 4037) insures against all risks of physical loss or damage, subject to policy limits and exclusions. It is comparable to a comprehensive policy in habitational insurance.

Note that there is a Broad Form Homeowner Policy which provides all-risks coverage on the building and named perils on the contents. However, in commercial insurance, a Broad Form is entirely all-risks, so the loss is insured unless a specific exclusion in the policy says it is not. When you hear the term “Broad Form,” it’s important to be clear whether it’s a personal or commercial policy.

Even the term “all-risks” is a misnomer. It would be rare to find an insurance policy which insures against all losses without exception. All policies contain exclusions for both property and perils insured, as well as a number of miscellaneous conditions. Insureds need to be reminded that even the broadest coverage forms have limitations in what they insure.

Earlier in this chapter, we learned the definition of property, what it includes, and what needs to be identified on the declarations page. Now, we’ll examine the specific property and perils that are excluded under the Broad Form.

Examples of excluded property include:

• Sewers, drains, and watermains located beyond the outside bearing walls.

• Street clocks and exterior signs.

• Animals, birds, and fish.

• Money, platinum, cash cards, evidence of debt or title.

• Automobiles, watercraft, aircraft (but not unlicensed automobiles or unlicensed trailers) used on the insured premises while on the insured’s business.

• Property in the custody of sales representatives outside the premises, unless an amount is shown on the declarations page for the sales representative.

• Any pressure vessel having a working pressure greater than 103 kilopascals.

• Any boiler, including its connecting pipe and equipment, containing steam or water under steam pressure.

Examples of excluded perils include:

• Earthquake.

• Flood.

• Seepage and leakage.

• Backup or overflow of water from sewers, sumps, septic tanks, and drains.

• The entrance of rain, sleet, or snow through doors, windows, skylights, or other openings.

• Centrifugal force, mechanical, or electrical breakdown.

• Failure to control temperature or humidity.

• Trade losses.

• Pollution and contamination.

Neither of these lists are exhaustive, so be sure to consult the Broad Form wording for other exclusions.

10.3.7.3 Common Clauses

Below are some of the common clauses attached to all policies, excerpted from the Broad Form.

10.3.7.3.1 Debris Removal Clause

“The insurer will indemnify the insured for expenses incurred in the removal of debris of the property insured occasioned by loss or damage to such property, for which loss or damage insurance is afforded under this form.”

Insurance is intended to repair, rebuild, or replace property after a loss. However, when there is a significant loss, insureds will also incur additional expense in removing the debris from the premises. If the limits of insurance have not been fully used to pay for damage insured by the policy, the insurer agrees to allow insureds to use any remaining amounts to pay for debris removal.

This coverage is not provided when all limits are used up to pay for a claim.

10.3.7.3.2 Reinstatement Clause

“Loss under any items on this form shall not reduce the applicable amount of insurance.”

Under contract law, the insurer’s financial obligation to the insured is over when the limits of insurance have been fully used to pay claims. However, the unique nature of insurance contracts has resulted in insurers including the reinstatement clause in commercial and other property insurance policies. This clause means that the limits of insurance provided by the policy remain unchanged for the entire policy period, regardless of the number and amounts of claims paid.

10.3.7.3.3 Subrogation Clause

“The insurer, upon making any payment or assuming liability therefore under this form, shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery of the insured against others and may bring action to enforce such rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of subrogation are hereby waived against any corporation, firm, individual, or other interest with respect to which insurance is provided by this policy.”

We know that when the insurer pays a claim for damage caused to the insured’s property by others, it is entitled to seek recovery from the responsible party. The insurer agrees not to exercise the right of subrogation against any party having an insurable interest in the property insured, such as payees, business partners, and subsidiary firms.

10.3.7.3.4 Other Common Clauses

There are many other clauses, such as breach of condition, property protection systems, premium adjustments, basis of valuation, property of others, and locked vehicle warranty. These clauses are included in the policy wording and are followed by the definitions and the policy conditions or Statutory Conditions.

10.4 OTHER COVERAGES AVAILABLE

We’ve learned that providing coverage in commercial insurance can be a very complex process, both in terms of the risks presented by the insureds and the policies available. A thorough understanding of the client’s needs, and what is available in the market to meet those needs, requires experience and further study.

We have seen that there are some property and peril exclusions on the policies which would negatively affect a business’s ability to properly operate in the market. There may be other specific circumstances that are not covered by the Named Perils Form or the Broad Form. For example, an insured may have several locations, may have property in transit, or may have property at other off premises locations. We’ll take a brief look at several additional coverages and forms that are available to respond to most client needs. These are only a few examples, and there are many more coverages available to brokers.

10.4.1 Property Away from the Insured Premises Policy

Commercial property insurance coverages apply only at the location noted on the declarations page. For an additional premium, coverage can be purchased and added to the policy to provide for both property in transit (by both the insured’s and others’ vehicles) and property at a temporary location not owned, rented, or controlled by the insured.

10.4.2 Glass Coverage Policy

Limited coverage is available under the Broad Form for exterior glass. Exterior or interior glass (such as in a mall) requires additional coverage. Many tenants, whether in a mall or street-facing building, have leases that require them to be responsible for loss to the glass of their unit. The combination of glass, ornamentation, lettering, and artwork is a significant investment for the insured.

Many insurers’ glass coverage policies provide as few as three exclusions:

1) Fire.

2) War.

3) Nuclear energy hazard.

10.4.3 Valuable Papers and Records Policy

Valuable papers are defined in IFC 51065 as “written, printed and otherwise inscribed documents and records, including books, maps, films, drawings, abstracts, deeds, mortgages and manuscripts but does not mean money or securities.”

Standard commercial property insurance policy coverages restrict payment for records to their blank value only. But when an insured purchases this coverage, all costs of reproducing lost or damaged documents are covered.

10.4.4 Accounts Receivable Policy

Many insureds extend credit to their customers through their business. If those records are destroyed, this policy can offer coverage. The act that destroyed them (that is, the peril) does need to be listed in this policy for it to respond, but the intent of the coverage is to pay the costs of reconstructing accounts receivable records, abnormal expenses incurred in collecting sums due to the insured, and interest charges on loans needed to offset uncollected amounts.

10.4.5 Office Equipment Floater

Businesses operate in a variety of forms, from retail to manufacturing — but offices are extremely common. Unlike retail or manufacturing environments, these office businesses (such as accountants, lawyers, and insurance brokers) do not contain any stock under the strict definition, but they do contain equipment. This policy provides all-risks coverage on all the office equipment, and generally includes accounts receivable, valuable papers, and extra expense.

10.4.6 Electronic Data Processing Policy

Very few businesses can operate without automation. From inventory control in warehouses to sales checkout in retail stores, all businesses rely on automated systems to some degree. Even operations in insurance brokerages, from application to record storage, are digitized. This means a computer failure can result in a total shutdown of a business operation.

Coverage under the standard commercial property forms is often not sufficient to fully address the unique losses that insureds using automated systems are exposed to. The Broad Form typically excludes losses caused by artificially generated electrical currents (for example, a power surge).

The loss of data is excluded under the Broad Form Policy, so insureds need to purchase coverage for the computer system in their office or business through an electronic data processing policy. There is no standard policy for this purpose, so brokers must be aware that the following coverages need to be on the form for their client:

• Loss to data processing systems, including equipment and component parts.

• Active data processing media, including programs.

• Extra expense.

Clients will need coverage for the hardware, the software, and the expenses to rent systems from others until the covered property is back online. An all-risks policy will provide coverage for water losses, including leakage, seepage, freezing, and flood, as well as mechanical breakdown.

There are exclusions on all policies, so be aware of the limitations on each form.

10.4.7 Crime Insurance Policy

Commercial property insurance typically provides coverage for riots, vandalism, and malicious acts. The Broad Form policy provides coverage for theft of stock and equipment. However, even the broadest policies exclude money, securities, jewellery, furs, and other valuable property when the loss is due to a criminal act. As always, brokers need to be deeply knowledgeable about their insured’s business in case there are exposures requiring additional coverages.

Burglary insurance is required in any business where the stock or equipment has high value or by its nature is very attractive to thieves. Burglary insurance will only pay when there are signs of forced entry to or from the insured property. The insured can purchase either mercantile stock burglary insurance or safe burglary insurance.

Robbery insurance is purchased where there is potential loss to money, securities, and other valuable property. Robbery insurance will pay when there is the threat of force against the person having control of the property (for example, a thief threatening a staff member with harm to turn over cash from the register). Robbery insurance applies to both inside and outside the premises.

Theft is the broadest form of crime, involving property taken without the owner’s consent. An insured who purchases theft coverage does not have to purchase burglary or robbery insurance, but the premium will reflect the extent of this coverage. Theft coverage includes options such as: Broad Form (covering stock and equipment); Money and Securities Broad Form; Employee Theft and Fidelity coverages; and the Comprehensive Dishonesty, Disappearance, and Destruction Policy (also known as the 3-D Policy).

The 3-D Policy provides a comprehensive package of crime insurance coverage under a single policy form. It includes five insuring agreements, and there are 48 approved endorsements to this policy which allow the broker to amend the coverage to a particular risk.

10.4.8 Cyber Insurance

Cyber insurance is designed to protect businesses against the financial loss resulting from a range of cyber threats and exposures, including cybercrime, data breach, and system interruption. If a business operates online, sends or receives e-transfers, or processes sensitive data, they require more than a standard policy. Property policies are designed to cover the bricks and mortar of a business, not the digital assets.

Employees at businesses of all types and sizes may not know what to look out for when it comes to phony links or possible malicious files. Clicking or downloading these can lead to a range of issues including extortion (where hackers threaten to expose data that they have accessed) social engineering (where hackers imitate someone to steal money (and ransomware), which can cripple an organization by freezing or damaging business-critical computer systems). These losses are not considered a data breach, but they can lead to severe financial damage and are insurable under a cyber policy.

A cyber insurance policy can give access to technical resources, including IT security experts, forensic investigators, lawyers to give legal advice on ransom demands, and crisis communications specialists who can help manage the situation and get the firm back online as soon as possible. The business interruption section covers the cost of getting data and applications repaired, restored, or recreated if your systems are damaged as a result of a cyber event. It can also reimburse loss of profits as a result of a cyber event interruption.

Policies come with proactive risk management tools, such as employee cybersecurity training programs to help prevent phishing attacks and dark-web monitoring, which scans the dark-web for signs that data relating to the business have been compromised.33

10.4.9 Intellectual Property

Intellectual property (IP) is anything that has been created or commissioned by a business. These can include copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. Examples of IP include photography, product names, designs, software/hardware, logos, inventions, and sound recordings.

An IP insurance policy is coverage designed to protect a business if there is an IP infringement or to provide defense if there is an IP infringement against a business. The policy can cover the legal fees of defending or pursuing a claim, damages, and settlement costs.

In the same realm is copyright insurance, which is designed to protect an organization’s written and creative content, as well as processes and software development, from being replicated or near replicated by another organization. Trademark insurance is to protect brand assets such as logos, recognizable signs, and designs from duplication or use without permission.

The cost of defending or pursuing an IP claim can be extensive and potentially threaten the survival of a company.34

10.4.10 Equipment (Boiler and Machinery) Breakdown Policy

The Broad Form commercial policy is the most common policy sold. Though the policy is all-risk, there are certain perils excluded. As such, where a loss occasioned from those perils would have a disastrous effect on the business operation, a separate policy must be purchased.

There are many working parts of a commercial operation that involve various forms of power generation to drive systems and machinery. The steam, mechanical, and electrical systems of a building all present challenges to be dealt with by the broker in the analysis of the risk.

Loss or damage to any pressure vessels having a normal, internal working pressure above 103 kilopascals or 15 psi are not insured. This includes hot water heaters and compressors used in the building. Steam heat is used to warm pipes to keep fluids moving in a refinery, and compressors drive air-driven mechanical systems. The resultant damage to the building would be excluded.

Loss occasioned by centrifugal force, mechanical, or electrical breakdown in or on the premises is excluded. Centrifuges are used to separate liquids. Mechanical breakdown means a failure in the working mechanism of the machinery, and electrical breakdown means a failure in the electrical mechanism of the machinery, appliance, or device. Electrical breakdown is usually caused by power surges or sudden reductions. It also includes the computers used primarily to stop, start, control, or operate any insured object.

It must be noted that loss by lightning damage, explosion of natural or manufactured gas, or resultant fire is always covered. This is known as a “following fire” and comes from the basic fire policy.

The equipment breakdown coverage form previously known as “boiler and machinery” provides coverage for loss caused by an accident to an “object”. The “object” is any property owned, leased, operated, or controlled by the insured while at the location specified in the policy. This means pressure objects and machinery objects. “Accident” is defined as an event that triggers coverage under the policy. It must be sudden, there must be a breakdown, there must be physical damage to the object, and there must be a need to repair or replace.

This policy provides coverage to the property of the insured and the object in use or connected ready for use at a location. There is a maximum payable for loss from any one accident. The damaged property shall be repaired or replaced with like kind, capacity, size, and quality.

Occurrences of a maintenance nature are not included, such as deterioration, corrosion, wear and tear, and the functioning of a safety device.

One of the unique features of this policy is that inspection services are provided, which will certify the equipment. If the inspector deems the equipment unfit or dangerous, they can tag the equipment and suspend coverage immediately, without notice to mortgagees or others.

10.4.11 Contractor Insurance

Contractors need insurance coverage for the building during construction as well as their tools and the equipment and systems they install in the buildings.

Builder’s risk insurance provides the basis of the policy provided to the contractor, and the tool floater rider, contractor’s equipment rider, and installation floater can be added to it.

A builder’s risk policy can be on either a Named Perils or a Broad form. It provides coverage for the period of construction and are referred to a Course of Construction (COC) policy. It can be purchased on an individual risk basis or on a blanket basis, depending on the number of projects a contractor is involved in. The premium is based on the maximum value of any single project and includes both material and labour. A premium is charged at the inception of the policy. The rate is based on a low inception value as the project gets started, leading to the full construction value at completion. A provisional premium is charged and there may be requirements to report at stated times the values of construction. Within 30 days of completion, the insured is required to advise the actual completed contract price, and the premium is adjusted accordingly. The form is used to provide coverage to insure contractors who are in the business of installation, reconstruction, or repair.

The broad form has three property components. The property during construction, installation, reconstruction, or repair, and any property of others that is integral to the project or that forms part of the completed project. Landscaping that forms part of the project and is included in the valuation and temporary buildings. Scaffolding, forms, and site preparation that form part of the project and are valued in the insurance. Excluded are tools and equipment, whether owned or leased, and the cost of making good faulty material, workmanship, or design.

Coverage normally ceases when the building comes into use or becomes occupied. Coverage automatically ceases when the project has been left unattended or when there has been no construction activity for more than 30 days.

The more restrictive Named Perils form provides coverage that are the same as the Commercial Building, Stock, and Equipment Named Perils Form.

Contractors, mechanics, and carpenters will have major off-premises exposure for loss of tools and equipment. Most commercial property forms restrict coverage for these items to losses occurring on premises. The tool floater rider extends coverage to off-premises coverage. Two of the main exclusions on the all-risk rider are for damage by artificial electricity and mysterious disappearance. Coverage can be provided either on a scheduled basis or on a blanket basis.

Claims are paid on an ACV basis.

The contractor’s equipment floater covers all kinds of moveable equipment owned, rented, or leased by contractors, including cranes, loaders, and road-building machinery, air compressors, cement mixers, and welding machines. The coverage can be written on either a scheduled or blanket basis. There is a provision for newly acquired equipment with a 30-day reporting limit.

As with any all-risk policy, there are exclusions. This form excludes losses caused by exceeding the load limit on a piece of equipment, mechanical or electrical breakdown, extremes of temperature, and rust or corrosion.

The Installation Floater is designed for contractors who specialize in the installation of machinery and equipment. Examples would be plumbing, heating, and air conditioning firms. The property covered may consist of “the property of the insured and of others for which the insured is legally liable or to be used in the or incidental to the installation operations of the insured”. It provides coverage while in transit (by most forms of transportation, including common carrier or insured’s vehicle), while awaiting installation at the site, and during installation, up to the time the interest of the insured ceases.

Premium is based on the contractor’s annual receipts. A provisional premium is charged at inception and balanced out at conclusion based on the receipts.

There are exclusions to this all-risks form, such as property while located at premises owned, leased, or occupied by the insured (coverage afforded under the Commercial Property policy), tools or equipment owned by the insured or others (covered under the tool floater), and losses caused directly or indirectly by faulty workmanship or material unless fire or explosion ensues. The values insured should properly reflect the maximum values likely to be exposed to loss in any one occurrence.35

10.5 SPECIFIC POLICY FORMS

In this section, we’ll look at some of the essential policies that businesses must either (1) have or (2) be made clearly aware that they need. We’ll examine each and how they are applied.

10.5.1 Business Interruption Insurance

Businesses run on their own will, planning, and funding — but they may experience a stop to their operations that they did not entirely intend. When external factors pressure a business to cease operations, this can be considered a business interruption. However, business interruptions are not always straightforward, so let’s look into this policy.

Commercial property insurance policies typically insure only the direct damage caused to the building, stock, and equipment. When there is a significant loss to property, one of two things can happen:

1) The business may be forced to close for a lengthy period. A closure lasting a few days may reduce the company’s business, while a lengthy closure (for example, weeks or months) can be disastrous (for example, the months-long closures during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic).

2) The business is able to resume partial operations only at the insured or other locations.

Business interruptions can come from many different sources other than damage to property. There can be a failure or breakdown of public utilities, transportation accidents (for example, the 1979 Mississauga train derailment), damage to neighbouring premises, loss caused by property damage of a major supplier, or actions of a regulatory authority.

During this period, when income is stopped, insureds have a few options to get their business back up and operating. They can dip into their own capital reserves (if they have any) or they can take out a bank loan (which they have to pay back from future earnings). Unfortunately, most businesses that experience a major property loss fail to reopen after three months, because they are unable to pay for continuing expenses during the interruption. Transferring that risk to an insurance company can help ensure the survival of that business.

Business interruption serves the following functions:

• It is a contract of indemnity, designed to restore the lost income to a level it would have been prior to the loss. It pays the business’s ongoing expenses (including salaries for key management personnel, taxes, and mortgage payments) and expenses which continue after a loss, as well as lost profits.

• It insures the same perils as the property policy.

• Its coverage is not limited to the policy period. Business interruption coverage starts on the day of the loss to the property and can continue for a specified period (usually 12 months). It will continue even if the property policy expires during that period.

• It will pay expenses when they are required to reduce the amount of the loss.

Note: Business interruption insurance is not a standalone policy form. Coverages are provided through endorsement to the property policy. Additionally, business interruption indemnity must first be triggered by a coverage occurrence under the property section.

There are two key approaches to business interruption coverage, as well as a third option:

1) Gross Earnings Form: The indemnity period commences at the time of loss and ceases upon reinstatement of the lost or damaged property. By ceasing payment at this time, the Gross Earnings Form assumes that the insured is returning to the competitive position they were immediately prior to the loss.

2) Profits Form: The indemnity period commences at the time of loss and continues until the income is restored to the level that would have been earned if the loss had not occurred, subject to the indemnity period selected at inception. The assumption here is that, although the doors of the business are open, the business has not been restored to its former competitive position. It will take time before profits are restored to the pre-loss level and to win back customers after a prolonged interruption. The Profits Form has a higher premium due to this longer coverage period.

Note: Both forms normally insure loss of income for a 12-month period. This can be increased for an additional premium.

3) Extra expense insurance endorsement: This is not a true business interruption insurance form because it does not insure loss of income. Instead, this form insures the necessary extra expenses or costs incurred by insureds in continuing normal business operations after a loss. Businesses purchasing this coverage include those which could (or need) to be back in business after a short interruption, such as insurance brokers, travel agents, doctors, an banks. In these situations, the business’s physical location is important, but not vital in the short term — so lost income due to location loss is not of major concern for these types of businesses.

Extra expense coverage is limited to those expenses that are over and above those which normally would have been incurred by the insured had the loss not occurred. These extra costs include:

• Renting temporary premises.

• Renting temporary equipment.

• Paying overtime salaries.

The insured would buy a single limit, and payment is spread out over a defined period.

Note: This form should be added for any insured who has either the Gross Earnings Form or the Profits Form.

Brokers are often intimidated by business interruption insurance, because they think that they need an accounting background to make the calculations required to get the right amounts for the correct policy limit. While it is true that a basic understanding of income and expenses is very valuable, many brokers use a work sheet to help in the calculations. Once you’ve gained more experience and pursued further study, you’ll feel better prepared to deal with this very important coverage.

10.6 SURETY BONDS

The concept of surety is thousands of years old. It means the state of being sure, certain, and secure — but by extension, it has also come to mean a guarantee of performance made by one person or entity for another. Its basic function is to eliminate risk to the person to whom the promise of performance is made.

However, surety is not the same as insurance! Surety, by its very nature, requires special noninsurance skills, such as accounting and finance. Though experience is a great teacher, some ancillary skills are required before a broker should enter the field of surety bonding.

The seven characteristics of a surety bond are:

1) There are three parties to a contract.

Image

The principal is the party primarily liable (for example, a contractor hired to build a house).

Image

The obligee is the party to whom someone else is obligated under contract (for example, the owner of the house needing the contractor).

Image

The surety is the party who promises to pay (money) or to perform some other act if the principal fails to fulfill their contractual obligation (for example, a bonding company affiliated with the house contractor).

2) No losses are expected.

Image

The surety thoroughly investigates the creditworthiness and business experience of the principal and extends credit without risk.

3) The principal is liable to the surety.

Image

If the principal fails in its obligation to the obligee (for example, fails to build the house), the surety must fulfill that promise. The principal is then obligated to the surety for the amounts it paid.

4) There is a bond premium, which is effectively a service fee. This is a fee charged for prequalification and company expenses to underwrite the risk.

5) There is a bond limit, or penalty, which the surety will pay to the obligee if the principal defaults. The penalty remains unchanged through the contract period.

6) A surety is of indeterminate length and non-cancellable.

Image

7) It is a written contract and executed under seal of the surety and principal.

Image

Termination occurs when the principal’s obligation has been fulfilled.

Image

Oral contracts are not binding on the surety.

Note: The guarantee provided by the surety can be viewed as an extension of credit, as it is the amount of funds available to the obligee if the principal defaults. For sureties to qualify principals, they look at three criteria called the “Three Cs.”

Character: A review of the company’s management performance to assess if they are of good character, have a good reputation in their industry and pay their bills promptly.

Capacity: Does the principal have the knowledge, experience, and labour pool necessary to do the job?

Capital: Does the principal have the financial capability to complete current jobs in addition to taking on future jobs?

Once the principal has met all Three Cs, the surety then decides whether to qualify them for a bond and at what rates.

10.6.1 Types of Surety Bonds

Surety bonds include many types of contract bonds. For example, there are:

• Construction bonds: The owners of a project face various risks in the management of the project. Successful bidders who fail to enter into the project can stall the project and cost time and money. Contractors who fail to complete the project on time and on budget can jeopardize the project. Contractors who fail to pay their sub-trades and suppliers can result in protracted litigation. In response to these challenges, contractors provide bid bonds, performance bonds, labour and material payment bonds, and maintenance bonds to cover warranty of the completed work.

The size of the bonds a contractor can get is based on their capacity, which is also defined (see above) as the maximum amount of surety credit a surety company will provide. Surety credit is the size of the bond that will be made available to the contractor and is based on the largest single project the surety would be willing to consider for a bond.

Contractors may source a bond for a particular individual project, but most often they develop a relationship with a surety to prearrange limits. They pre-qualify themselves for bonds and pre-set their capacity so they can enter the bidding process in a timely manner. As the contractor gains in experience and grows in capital, their capacity expands. As the contractor establishes greater capacity, they can bid on larger and more complex projects.

A portion of capacity determination is based on a multiplier of the contractor’s working capital. If they had $1M in working capital, they could qualify for $10-$20M in credit. This would, for example, give a contractor the opportunity to bid on a $5M individual project with a maximum of $20M aggregate on all other bonded work.

• Fiduciary bonds: These are required for each insurance brokerage under the RIB Act. Fiduciary bonds are required when you have people in a position of trust who are handling the funds of others. These bonds also apply to persons appointed by the courts to act as estate administrators, guardians, or trustees.

Estate administrators are one of the most common fiduciary bonds. This bond guarantees the faithful performance of the administration, according to law, of a deceased person’s estate. The court-appointed administrator, or the executor named in the will, have a responsibility to settle estates either as specified in the will or as approved by the court.

A guardian is a person nominated in a will and appointed by the court to manage the affairs of a minor. The guardianship bond guarantees that the guardian will perform their duties faithfully, observe the directives of the court, and account for all money and other property when required by the court. Failure to do so makes the guardian liable to the court.

Upon application for bankruptcy, a trustee is appointed by the court to liquidate all assets and divide the remaining assets among the creditors. A Trustee Bond is filed with the court guaranteeing the faithful performance of the duties according to the rules. Failure to do so makes the trustee liable to the court.

• Customs and excise bonds: These are required for custom-bonded warehouses which guarantee the collection of duty and taxes on goods brought into the country.

• License and permit bonds: These are required by all levels of government for businesses operating under their respective jurisdictions. Businesses operating publicly must post the required bonds to ensure they meet the statutes, regulations, or ordinances under which they operate. This is meant to protect the general welfare of the public.

In summary, bonds can produce many different forms, and there are situations where there is no existing bond form. In these cases, the surety company may agree to issue a bond based on a proposed wording submitted by the applicant. In all cases, the purpose is to make the obligee feel sure, certain, and secure in their relationship with the principal.

10.7 PACKAGE POLICIES

For individually rated commercial policies, insurers use both the Named Perils Form and Broad Form (but the Broad Form is by far the more common policy in use today). However, their use as standalone forms is decreasing as package policies become more popular. The insurance industry thrives on competition, and insurers are always looking for ways to attract new business.

The package policy accomplishes just that. It is a multi-peril, multi-line policy which incorporates all coverages under a single policy form. These policies are developed with specific industries or associations in mind, so they incorporate extensions, coverages, and limits that are unique to that industry or association.

Package policy coverages are not standardized, but they generally include the following:

• Property insurance.

• Business interruption insurance.

• Liability insurance.

• Crime insurance.

Premiums are based on what the insurer deems to be the quality of the average exposure, and credits are given for select or superior risks. Though there is a common form for each program, the credits earned by the individual risk quality make each package policy unique to the insured.

The advantage of package policies is the simplicity of the application form. Premiums are easily determined, coverage is usually more than adequate for most risks, and the broad coverages provided eliminate many of the claims problems common to the more limited forms.

The disadvantage of this approach is that one size does not fit all. When brokers conduct their surveys, they must identify areas where the package policy’s preset limits may have a serious effect on the coverage limits required by the insured. Because package policies lack standardization, it is difficult to make comparisons. Over-reliance on the package policy may leave some insureds seriously underinsured. Ultimately, an individually tailored commercial policy may be a more effective way to deal with your clients’ insurance needs.

10.8 COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE & THE SHARING ECONOMY

What you are about to study in this section is only the tip of the iceberg. It is important to remember that commercial insurance is both a very complicated client base and policy space to be in. Again, we reiterate, you should have a few years’ experience as a proficient personal lines broker at least before going into the commercial lines of insurance. Now, let’s take a look into two areas of commercial insurance, commercial automobile and the sharing economy.

10.8.1 Licensing of Commercial Operators

OAP 1, Section 1 1.4.5 states: “You agree not to drive or operate the automobile, or allow anyone else to drive or operate the automobile, while not authorized by law.” Because of this condition, certain accident benefits are also forfeited under the same rule (see Section 4.4 Limitations on Your Coverage). The Ontario “G” license for motor vehicles, includes snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), but motorcycles require an “M” license. So, for any person to operate these personal lines vehicles, there is an existing government licensing structure.

For commercial uses of vehicles, a “G” license is sufficient for vehicles with a total weight under 11,000 kgs, whereas for vehicles over 11,000 kgs, a “D” license is required. The law also states that no person shall drive or operate a commercial motor vehicle over 4,500 kgs gross weight on a highway unless the operator is a holder of a commercial vehicle operators registration (CVOR). A CVOR is issued by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), and it must be carried at all times for inspection reasons. There is an annual inspection process of these vehicles required and managed by the MTO.

10.8.2 Commercial Automobile Insurance

We have seen that the OAP 1 provides the mandatory and optional coverages required to operate a properly licensed motor vehicle in Ontario and that coverage extends to Canada and the United States. Within that policy, there are exclusions and limitations that require the application of specific endorsements to extend coverage to these uses. Carrying passengers for compensation, the contents of vehicles and trailers (whether owned or for hire), or the non-personal use of the vehicle affect the rating of the vehicles and coverages.

Image

We still use the OAP 1 policy, but we amend the rating to consider the change or increase in the risk or exposure. When the automobile or light truck is used for more than commuting to and from work, or is now used to call on clients, it is given a business rating. A small contractor or a plumber with a light vehicle (such as a pickup truck or panel van) would be given a commercial rating, but this can still be covered on a personal lines policy. A commercial vehicle supplement (CVS) is used by the broker to help determine whether a risk should stay in personal lines or move to commercial lines.

When a vehicle is used to carry passengers for compensation (such as a taxi, school bus or driver training school vehicle), a series of OPCF 6 endorsements are added to the vehicle, and the appropriate increased rating and premium are applied to the vehicle. Provincial or state liability requirements for public vehicles may also affect coverages.

When a vehicle is rated in the “heavy” class, coverage typically moves to commercial automobile insurance.

Because commercial automobile insurance requires an understanding of different kinds of vehicles and how they are being used, it requires a more technical approach to underwriting. When a business operation owns a few vehicles, each can be insured on either one or several automobile policies, and a premium and rating are applied to each vehicle. When an operation gets larger and owns multiple vehicles, which may or may not include trailers, the policy format changes to determine how to rate and charge a premium for the exposure, but it does not change the policy from the OAP 1.

When shifting an automobile policy from personal lines to commercial lines, underwriters will also begin to consider with items such as cargo and attached equipment where the underwriters in the commercial lines property and liability department would be called on to provide coverage.

Commercial lines automobile insurance includes both individual rated commercial automobiles (IRCA) (which can be scheduled if there is more than one vehicle) and fleet rated policies. IRCA are scheduled on a per unit basis to reflect the individual limits and coverages per vehicle. There may be different coverages on different vehicles within the list.

A fleet rated risk involves four or more vehicles under a common ownership, and the rating can be either on a scheduled or fleet basis. A scheduled basis is where each unit is noted, coverages are shown, and a premium is charged. Vehicles to be added, deleted, or substituted are reported as they occur to the insurer. Fleets can also be covered on a blanket basis by adding an OPCF 21 endorsement (which has several forms), where the fleet owner reports vehicles either owned or leased monthly. Large fleets with varying needs would use this method to control expenses. The premium charged can be based on either monthly receipts or mileage. This method more accurately reflects the risk exposure. The busier a business is, or the more extensive its range of operations (for example, long-haul trucking to the United States as opposed to local haulage), will determine the premium paid. Seasonal variations are also brought into play in determining premium. Vehicles laid up in the winter would reduce the premium, whereas increased use in the summer would increase the premium.

Image

Coverage for contents (that is, the cargo) of a commercial vehicle is excluded under an OAP 1 and requires the services of an inland marine underwriter. Inland marine provides coverage against loss or damage to cargo while in transit. The carrier is called a “bailee for hire” and is responsible for certain losses caused to property while in their possession. These carriers fit into three categories, depending on how they operate their business:

• common carriers (like tractor trailers that you pass on the highway),

• contract carriers (like the vans that deliver Amazon packages), and

• private carriers (like company-branded vehicles for Leon’s furniture or Voila).

Common carriers are subject to provincial, interstate, and municipal regulations requiring the issuance of insurance certificates. This is to show they carry proper liability coverages from an acceptable insurer. They are also subject to regulated tariffs that set both the rates carriers can charge and the liability for the types of goods carried. Common carriers would protect themselves by purchasing a truckman’s liability cargo rider, which provides coverage for goods they carry. As the carrier picks up and drops off from various locations through the day or week, they may face challenges in determining the value of the cargo they are hauling. The cargo limit on the rider may be inadequate for the value of the goods they are hauling. The owners of the property being transported would probably have their own transportation floater added to their property policy or have a trip transit policy for single shipments.

Contract carriers only carry goods for certain customers where responsibility for goods carried is determined by the individual contracts, and private carriers carry only their own goods. Each of would know the value of goods carried and have the proper insurance in place. For example, a local furniture or grocery store hires vehicles for doing home delivery. The owner of the property would normally provide the coverage for the goods being transported. They would add a motor cargo rider or transportation rider to their property policy.

When a commercial operation has attached equipment on its vehicles, the use of that attached equipment is excluded from the auto policy by endorsement (OPCF 30). Both liability and accident benefits are now excluded when the equipment is used. Coverage is put back on to that equipment by a commercial liability policy. Cranes and hoisting equipment, welders, and drilling rigs are examples where multiple policies are required to provide the proper coverage for commercial exposure.

Brokers dealing with commercial automobile exposures need to have an increased awareness of the exposures presented by the insured. They need to have thorough training in all the forms that customize a policy, because failure to properly underwrite the risk can result in large E&O claims.

10.8.3 Sharing Economy

The sharing economy first appeared over 20 years ago in the United States. It emphasized the collaborative use or consumption of goods and/or services within the general public. Also known as the “gig economy”, this is predominately based on software platforms to connect providers to customers, facilitating transactions between these two parties without the need to invest in new property, locations, equipment, or much extra capital. Today, most of us know Uber and Airbnb, but Etsy, Fiverr, and SkipTheDishes are extensions of this economic model into more specific industries. Your clients could very well be using one of these services, and you might not even know to ask. However, it is incumbent upon the broker to conduct a thorough needs assessment with every client, commercial or not, to identify all risks a client is exposed to so any policy issued will be an accurate reflection of their true exposures.

10.8.3.1 Ride Sharing

Image

Ride sharing is defined as an arrangement in which a passenger travels in a private vehicle, usually for a fee, and arranged by means of a website or a mobile application (or “app”)36. Because the use of the driver’s personal automobile is the premise of ride sharing (which changes the definition of “taxi”), and the OAP 1 excludes the use of paying customers, this new category risked leaving the driver without having coverage if an accident occurs while a paying customer is in their vehicle or while they are working for the ride sharing company. Since 2018, insurers have stepped in to provide specific coverage for ride sharing to provide coverage back to the vehicle owner if they are involved in an accident, including liability risks.

The pervasiveness of ride sharing workers means that many auto policyholders could very well be supplementing their income by driving for a fee, which means brokers must ask specific questions about uses of any personal automobile.

10.8.3.2 Accommodation Sharing

Many people today choose to stay not in a hotel, but in someone’s condo, house, or cottage when travelling. Accommodation sharing, also known as “short-term rental”, is a huge economy consisting of multiple international and local apps and a sizeable percentage of the housing inventory of any given country. On Airbnb alone, more than seven million dwellings were available with over 115 million bookings in 202237, making it highly likely that some clients are listing their dwellings as short-term rentals.

Accommodation sharing is defined as renting part or all of a property for a short period, including a primary or secondary residence. It also includes any rentals facilitated by a third party, a website, or an app38. Similar to ride sharing, it is vital that a broker do a thorough needs assessment of every client to capture their operation of their property, as much as identifying the structure itself, to ensure that the policy issued reflects the reality of the business, no matter how much of the property is engaged or how often.

10.9 CONCLUSION

This chapter has given you a peek into the world of commercial insurance, which can be more varied, complex, and costly than personal insurance. Commercial insurance is a field that takes time to develop expertise and competence in — but it’s one that many brokers strive to learn as their careers develop. Take some time to review the glossary and complete the quiz. See you in Chapter 11!
